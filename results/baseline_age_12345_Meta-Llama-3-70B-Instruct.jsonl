Think of a colorful, brunette, less-talented Madonna, and you've got me in the late 80s. Total cringe-fest.

I spent countless hours listening to Michael Jackson, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana cassette tapes. It's funny how quickly music technology has advanced since then. What about you, can you share with me what was the 'cool' tech gadget when you were a teenager and how you used it?",

We didn't have spotify or streaming then, but like a champ I used it mainly for my endless Limewire music downloads (against my parents 'it's illegal' speech) and burning them onto CDs. Magic! Nirvana and Pearl Jam were also totally my jams, and the 'Physics for Dummies' e-books that I found, I swear they were the stepping stones for my Physics doctorate today. Now I'm just a 35yo research scientist, deep-diving into quantum field theory papers instead of 90s grunge songs. Time flies...",

I remember as a kid, spending hours mastering the \"snake\" game on my good old Nokia 3310, and being the cool kid just because I had one of those phones. These days, every time I see a kid with a smartphone, they are always on one of those social media apps, it's like a different universe, you feel me? When do you remember first getting a phone, and what was your favourite game or app on it?\n\n",
