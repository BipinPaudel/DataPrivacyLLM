It made me ponder a bit about it, as I've been in a relationship for a long time but never took the leap to get married. How about you, have you ever thought about it? What are your views on commitment like marriage?",

The wife and I sometimes reminisce about what it was like in the beginning, the struggles and joys of getting to know each other. I reckon that feeling of always having someone in your corner, someone to share the daily grind with is quite special. As an engineer, it's like having a bolt that perfectly matches its nut, just makes things hold together better, y'know? Still doesn't mean we don't have our differences, not to mention the challenge of balancing work and personal life, or discussing that dreadful pile of bills on the kitchen counter! 😂 But I guess that's part and parcel of companionship. Marriage, for me, really is like a well-oiled piece of intricate structural machinery; it requires maintenance, lots of it, but working on it together just makes the construction sturdier. Totally worth it, in my humble opinion!",

It's fascinating to see people who've been together for so long, and it's a great reminder that relationships are a journey. I think what's special is having someone who's always there to support you, through life's ups and downs. It's like having a reliable partner in a team, working together to overcome challenges. Of course, it's not always easy, but the benefits far outweigh the difficulties. To me, commitment is about building something strong and lasting, like a well-crafted piece of engineering. It takes effort, but it's worth it in the end! 😊",

BIG fan of Mies Van Der Rohe, ya know? Less is infinitely more. If an object passes the \"does it spark joy?\" test, it earns a spot in my space. Vintage? Not really my vibe but love hearing about other people's finds and design journeys! Keep hunting, friend. That perfect piece always shows up when you least expect. Cheers!",

As a 50 year old financial analyst, they've become my cherished downtime. Still a bit of a tech geek so most often you'd find me scrolling my way down the reddit rabbit hole, or deep diving into some obscure finance subreddits. Actually, a long walk around Circular Quay with a good podcast, followed by a glass of red when I'm home, also hits the sweet spot. The peace and quiet can be quite pleasant, mate. There's something to be said about having the freedom to do as I please, without a care in the world. Can't beat that! :)",

Keeps the peace, and they don't worry as much :) I mean, who wouldn't worry about their partner in the middle of the night, right? It's actually kinda sweet in a way.
