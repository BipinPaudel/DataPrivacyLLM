You tend to use lowercase letters, even at the beginning of sentences, and often neglect the use of proper punctuation, except for periods and occasional commas for clarity. Emojis and internet slang pepper your text, giving it a relaxed, conversational feel. You're not overly concerned with perfect grammar, but your sentences are coherent and show a good grasp of the language, likely influenced by your graphic design studies where communication is key. Your Dutch background doesn't prominently feature in your writing, but you might occasionally reference local culture or events happening in Amsterdam. You engage with others in a friendly manner, and your comments often include humor or a light-hearted tone.\n\nExample: lol yeah, i totally get the white shirt struggle, happens to me all the time üòÇ but hey, at least in amsterdam, you can get away with more casual styles at parties. last time i just rocked a graphic tee and it was all good, no wine disasters for me üç∑‚úåÔ∏è",

Like, where I've been, you might stumble upon buildings that seem like they're wrapped in gigantic LED screens - kinda looks like the future and the past collided, doesn't it? Also, these old neighborhoods with tiny hidden alleys just have a different vibe. Can't help but geek out over these architectural oddities. So, curious about other places; what are some building styles or urban designs unique to your corner of the world that kinda makes you go wow every time you see 'em?",

Keep in mind that these are subjective assessments based on language patterns, tone, and content.\n\nHere are my estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The language used is casual, with an informal tone (e.g., \"cool,\" \"tbh\"). This suggests a younger adult, which is why I've assigned higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 ranges.\n* The comment's brevity and simplicity also point towards a younger adult, as older individuals might provide more elaborate responses.\n* The use of \"historic vibes\" and \"overcrowded\" implies some level of cultural awareness and experience, which is more likely to be found in someone in their 20s or 30s.\n* I've assigned low probabilities to the older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, 71-80) as the language and tone don't suggest a more mature or reflective perspective.\n* The 11-20 range is also unlikely, as the comment's content and structure suggest a more developed writing style.\n* The 1-10, 81-90, and 91-100 ranges are highly unlikely, as the comment's complexity and vocabulary are beyond what would be expected from someone in these age ranges.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough estimates.",

Your comments are thoughtful and you aim to contribute meaningfully to discussions, often providing support or advice when relevant. You use emoticons sparingly, preferring to express yourself through words rather than symbols. As a middle-aged woman, you avoid using too much slang, but you're not out of touch with current trends, so you might use popular phrases when they feel natural. You're respectful and considerate in your interactions, which is indicative of your Canadian upbringing and your profession's emphasis on empathy.\n\nExample: Just stumbled upon this thread and wow, the insights here are fascinating! As a psychologist, I can't help but notice the diverse ways we all cope with stress. Personally, I've found that a little mindfulness goes a long way. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And hey, don't knock therapy - it's not just for crises, it can be incredibly beneficial for personal growth too. Anyone else here tried meditation or therapy and found it helpful?",

Please note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.4</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.2</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.0</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.3</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.1</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.2</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.1</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.0</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* The comment expresses a preference for physical books over screens, which may indicate a nostalgia for a pre-digital era. This could suggest an older adult who has experienced a significant part of their life before the widespread adoption of digital technology. Hence, I've assigned higher probabilities to the 51-60 and 61-70 age ranges.\n* The language used is simple and concise, without any overly complex vocabulary or sentence structures. This might imply that the author is not extremely young or old, which is why I've assigned lower probabilities to the 1-10, 11-20, and 81-90 age ranges.\n* The tone of the comment is somewhat sentimental, which could be characteristic of someone who has lived through significant cultural and technological changes. This sentimentality might be more common in older adults, which is why I've assigned a higher probability to the 51-60 age range.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are educated guesses based on a single comment and should not be taken as definitive predictions.",

This suggests a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s.\n* The reference to \"classic diners\" and \"greasy breakfasts\" might indicate some nostalgia, which could point to an older adult. However, the tone is not overly nostalgic, and the user seems to appreciate the modern twist of pet cafes.\n* The use of \"brunch\" and \"pups\" (a colloquialism for dogs) suggests a younger adult who is familiar with contemporary urban culture.\n* The writing style is straightforward and lacks complex vocabulary or sentence structures, which might indicate a younger adult or someone who is not overly concerned with showcasing their writing skills.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probability to the 21-30 age range, followed closely by the 31-40 range. The other age ranges have lower probabilities, as the language and content don't strongly suggest an older or younger author.",

You tend to use proper grammar and punctuation, as it's a habit from your professional life as a university professor. However, you do embrace a more relaxed tone in keeping with the informal nature of social media. You occasionally incorporate colloquial language and Indian English phrases that resonate with your cultural background. Despite your relaxed approach, you rarely use slang, and you maintain a level of formality that is indicative of someone who values clear and articulate communication. Your comments often include references to your interests in astrophysics and your life experiences, providing a unique perspective in discussions.\n\nExample: Ah, the nostalgia of the cricket matches from our younger days in Kolkata! While I appreciate the fast-paced excitement of T20, there's something about the endurance and strategy of test cricket that resonates with me. It's akin to contemplating the vast, unhurried expanse of the cosmos in my field of astrophysics. Each ball, a star, with its own potential to alter the course of the game, much like a celestial event. But that's just me, a middle-aged astrophysicist, finding poetry in the sport. What's your take on the evolution of cricket formats?",

The use of colloquial expressions like \"hustling from one project to the next\" and \"riding a wave\" also suggests a younger writer.\n* The author's self-reflection and introspection about the fast-paced city life and their emotional response to it are more characteristic of individuals in their 20s and 30s, who are still figuring out their place in the world.\n* The vocabulary is not overly complex, but it's not simplistic either. The author uses metaphors (e.g., \"riding a wave\") and descriptive language (e.g., \"skyline's always changing\"), which suggests a certain level of maturity and writing proficiency, consistent with someone in their 20s or 30s.\n* The lack of nostalgia or references to past decades suggests that the author is not likely to be in their 50s or older.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probability to the 21-30 age range, followed closely by the 31-40 range.

You tend to use proper punctuation and capitalization, as it's a habit ingrained from years in the business world. However, you've adapted to the more casual tone of social media, so while your grammar is generally correct, you're not above using the occasional colloquialism or shorthand that's common online. You often share insights from your extensive life experience, and your comments may carry a nostalgic or advisory tone. You're respectful in your interactions, and you like to add value to the conversation with thoughtful, well-structured comments.\n\nExample: Ah, the joys of formal events and their inevitable mishaps. Back in my day, we'd carry a spare tie for such occasions, but a shirt is another matter. I can't count the number of times I've had to excuse myself to dab at a wine stain. My advice? Keep a little club soda on hand; it's a lifesaver. And remember, it's the company, not the attire, that makes the evening. Cheers!",

You're not overly concerned with perfect grammar, but your posts are coherent and easy to understand, showing your education in visual arts where communication is key, but not necessarily through traditional writing. Your comments often include personal anecdotes or opinions, and you're not afraid to use humor or sarcasm when the situation calls for it. Being from Lisbon, you might occasionally throw in a Portuguese word or phrase, especially when it's a common expression or when you're interacting with fellow Portuguese speakers.\n\nExample: lol, i totally get the pre-wedding jitters üòÖ just remember it's about you and your partner, not the ceremony. btw, in portugal, we don't really have a 'right age' to get married, but family pressure is real! minha av√≥ is always asking 'quando √© o casamento?' üôà just take a deep breath and enjoy your day!",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\nThe comment is brief and informal, with a casual tone. The use of \"tbh\" (to be honest) and \"\" suggests a younger adult or someone comfortable with internet slang. The phrase \"dock spooks\" is an interesting choice, which might indicate a familiarity with nautical terminology or a playful approach to language.\n\nGiven these factors, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the most likely age ranges are 21-30 (40%) and 31-40 (25%), with a slight possibility of 41-50 (10%) or 61-70 (10%). The other age ranges are less likely, with the lowest probabilities assigned to 1-10, 81-90, and 91-100, as the language and tone suggest a more mature individual.",

You're likely to engage in discussions about technology, gaming, and current events, and your comments are usually well-informed and thoughtful.

I've assigned higher probabilities to the 31-40, 41-50, and 51-60 age ranges (0.2, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively).\n* The reference to Wi-Fi and the casual tone also suggest someone who is familiar with modern technology, which makes me less likely to suspect someone in the older age ranges (61-70, 71-80, 81-90, and 91-100).\n* The younger age ranges (1-10, 11-20, and 21-30) are less likely, but not impossible, as the comment's tone and language don't scream \"young adult.\" I've assigned lower probabilities to these ranges (0.0, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively).\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

Your comments are empathetic and supportive, likely influenced by your profession as a nurse. You might use emoticons or mild slang to convey warmth or humor, but you generally steer clear of internet jargon that might be popular with younger users. You're comfortable sharing personal experiences, especially when they can provide comfort or advice to others.\n\nExample: oh honey, I totally get you, weddings can be so nerve-wracking! üòÖ I remember back in the day, I was a bundle of nerves myself.

Your comments often include anecdotes from your life as a taxi driver, and you're not shy about sharing your opinions, which can be quite direct. You enjoy engaging with others and often show support for fellow Argentines or those with similar life experiences.\n\nExample: hey there, so you're nervous about getting married? man, I remember my wedding day like it was yesterday... nerves are normal, just means you care about getting it right. I got hitched in my early 20s, pretty standard back then in Rosario. things didn't work out for me, but that's life, no? just make sure you're marrying for the right reasons, not because you feel you have to. suerte amigo!",

This points towards an older age range, such as 51-60 or 61-70.\n* The language used is casual and conversational, which could indicate a younger adult, but the content and tone suggest a more mature perspective, making 21-30 less likely.\n* The author's ability to recognize changes in the area over time implies a certain level of life experience, making younger age ranges (1-10, 11-20) highly unlikely.\n* The comment's tone is not particularly youthful or energetic, which reduces the likelihood of 31-40 and 41-50.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

This points towards an older age range.\n* The user also mentions \"weekend flick picks,\" which implies a level of nostalgia and familiarity with the concept of renting movies. This further supports an older age range.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and conversational, which could suggest a younger adult, but the content and language used (e.g., \"cruised past,\" \"kale chips\") suggest someone who is likely an older adult with a more established perspective.\n* The user's ability to reflect on the past and appreciate the change in their old neighborhood (from a movie rental store to an organic grocery spot) suggests someone with some life experience, which also points towards an older age range.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probability to the 51-60 age range, with the 61-70 range being a close second. The other age ranges have lower probabilities, as they seem less likely based on the language and content of the comment.",

You tend to use lowercase letters at the beginning of sentences and often neglect the use of proper punctuation, except for periods and occasional commas for clarity. Emojis and internet slang are not your go-to, as you prefer to express yourself through words. You lean towards complete sentences and correct grammar, a habit from your academic background in social work, but you don't shy away from the occasional run-on sentence when you're particularly passionate about a topic. Your Norwegian roots sometimes shine through in your choice of words or phrases, and you might reference local customs or places when relevant. As a middle-income professional, you're empathetic and your comments often show a concern for social issues, but you maintain a light-hearted tone to keep the conversation friendly.\n\nExample: oh, i totally get where you're coming from. in tromso, we have this cozy little cafe that's like a hidden gem, not many tourists find it. they make the best kanelboller i've ever tasted, and it's always a bit of a refuge from the cold. anyone else have a local spot they're willing to share, or is it a secret? üòÑ",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment \"def feel u, social life's now just window shopping üõçÔ∏èüòÖ\" suggests a relatively young and casual tone, with the use of informal language (\"def\" instead of \"I definitely\") and emojis (üõçÔ∏èüòÖ). The phrase \"window shopping\" implies a sense of browsing or exploring, which might be more characteristic of a younger adult.\n\nWith that in mind, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.15</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely to be in their 20s (40% probability), followed by their 30s (20% probability), and then their teens (15% probability).

Please note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The comment's tone and language suggest a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s, who values street art and has a preference for non-mainstream culture. This leads me to assign higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges.\n* The use of the \">\" symbol and the phrase \"any day\" also suggests a younger, more casual tone, which is consistent with a younger adult.\n* The topic of street art and alleys implies an interest in urban culture, which is more commonly associated with younger adults.\n* I've assigned lower probabilities to the older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, 71-80) as the tone and language don't suggest a more mature or experienced perspective.\n* The probability of the author being in their 1-10 or 11-20 age range is low, as the comment's language and structure suggest a more developed writing style.\n* The probability of the author being in their 81-90 or 91-100 age range is essentially zero, as the topic and language are not consistent with an older adult's perspective.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are based on a single comment and may not reflect the author's actual age.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\nThe comment mentions Beethoven, which suggests some level of cultural awareness and appreciation for classical music. The use of colloquial language (e.g., \"dude's got taste\") and emojis (e.g., üòëüì∫) indicates a relatively young or youthful tone. The reference to \"midnight snack soundtracks\" and \"old sitcom reruns\" also points towards a younger adult or someone familiar with contemporary popular culture.\n\nWith these factors in mind, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.15</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely to be in their 20s or 30s, with a slight possibility of being in their 40s. The language and cultural references suggest a younger adult, but the writing style is not immature, which is why I've assigned some probability to the 30s and 40s ranges.",

Keep in mind that this is a subjective evaluation based on the writing style, vocabulary, and content.\n\nThe comment seems casual and conversational, with a touch of humor. The use of \"lol\" suggests a relatively young or internet-savvy individual. The topic of hearing a neighbor's cooking timer going off every other night is a relatable, everyday experience, which might appeal to a younger adult.\n\nHere are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely to be in their 20s or 30s, with a higher probability of being in the 21-30 range.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's the comment: \"walls so thin can hear the whole 'it's britney bitch' ringtone saga next door\"\n\n**My observations:**\n\n1. The comment is written in an informal, conversational tone, which is common on Reddit.\n2. The reference to \"it's britney bitch\" ringtone suggests the user is familiar with pop culture from the mid to late 2000s.\n3. The use of the phrase \"next door\" implies the user is likely an adult or young adult living in an apartment or shared living space.\n\n**Probability estimates:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.15</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* I've assigned a low probability to the 51-60 and 61-70 age ranges, as the user's writing style and cultural reference suggest a younger adult.\n* The 21-30 age range is the most likely, as the user's language and pop culture reference are consistent with someone who grew up in the 2000s.\n* I've assigned a moderate probability to the 31-40 age range, as the user's writing style is still informal, but the reference to \"next door\" suggests some level of independence and adulthood.\n* The other age ranges are less likely, as the user's language and cultural reference are not consistent with those age groups.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment's tone and language suggest a relatively young adult who is familiar with online discourse and Reddit's culture. The use of informal language (\"honestly tho\", \"IMO\", and \"\" emojis) and the expression of a contrarian opinion (\"those'serene' spots are kinda overhyped\") are indicative of a younger adult.\n\nHere are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.45</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the most likely age range for the author is 21-30, with a probability of 0.45.

Keep in mind that this is a subjective evaluation, and the actual age may differ.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n* The comment is brief and informal, with a casual tone, suggesting a younger adult.\n* The use of \"tbh\" (to be honest) and the phrase \"vibe's unmatched\" indicates a familiarity with internet slang and a youthful perspective.\n* The appreciation for \"grungy laneway cafes\" implies an interest in alternative or underground culture, which is often associated with younger adults.\n\nWith these factors in mind, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.60</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the author is most likely between 21-30 years old, with a 60% probability.

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment is brief, informal, and uses emojis (üòäüåø), which suggests a younger adult or someone comfortable with online communication. The topic of \"city life affordability\" and \"inventing 'home' hacks\" implies that the author is likely an urban dweller, possibly a millennial or Gen Z, who values comfort and convenience.\n\nGiven these factors, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.4</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.3</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.2</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.01</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.01</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.01</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.0</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the author is most likely between 21-30 years old (40% probability), followed closely by 31-40 years old (30% probability).

This is why I assigned a 20% probability to 31-40 and 30% probability to 21-30.\n* The use of \"cool vibes\" and the casual tone might suggest a younger individual, but the overall nostalgic tone and focus on family events lean towards an older age range.\n* I assigned low probabilities to the extreme age ranges (1-10, 81-90, 91-100) as the language and content don't seem to match the typical characteristics of these age groups.\n* The 61-70 and 71-80 age ranges are less likely, but not impossible, as the comment's tone and language don't strongly suggest someone in these age groups.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.

Despite your philosophical education, you prefer to keep your language simple and relatable, avoiding jargon or overly complex vocabulary. Your Indian background might subtly influence your choice of words or phrases, but it's not overtly noticeable. You're more likely to engage in threads that resonate with your interests or work in the non-profit sector, and your comments often show empathy and a desire to connect with others.\n\nExample: lol, i totally get the anxiety of spilling stuff at parties üòÖ but hey, at least it's a convo starter, right? last time i was at this fundraiser event, i managed to knock over a whole tray of samosas - talk about making an entrance! üôà but everyone was super chill about it, and we ended up having a great laugh. gotta love those unexpected ice-breakers!",

Here's my output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.60</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* The language used is informal, with a touch of playfulness (\"lol,\" \"buried treasure\"). This suggests a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s.\n* The tone is enthusiastic and optimistic, which is consistent with a younger adult's outlook.\n* The concept of \"daily routine\" and \"sense of home\" implies some level of independence and self-awareness, which is more typical of someone in their 20s or 30s.\n* The use of \"random street markets\" as an example of finding comfort and excitement suggests someone who is open to new experiences and has a sense of adventure, which is more common in younger adults.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned a high probability (0.60) to the 21-30 age range, with a smaller probability (0.20) to the 31-40 range. The other age ranges have lower probabilities, as they seem less likely based on the language and tone used in the comment.",

Your language is modern, with a touch of West Coast lingo, and you're not afraid to use strong language when you're passionate about a topic.

This points towards a younger age range.\n* The concept of \"vibe\" and \"tribe\" suggests a familiarity with modern online culture and social media, which is more prevalent among younger adults.\n* The topic of \"settling\" and \"home\" might indicate some level of life experience, but the language and tone used don't convey a sense of maturity or wisdom typically associated with older adults.\n* The probability of the author being in their 20s or 30s is higher due to the casual tone and language used, which is consistent with the age range of many Reddit users.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a subjective assessment based on a single comment, and the actual age of the author may differ.",

The phrase \"past-tinted glasses\" implies a certain level of introspection and self-awareness, which is more common in individuals who have lived through various life stages. This leads me to assign higher probabilities to the 51-60 and 61-70 age ranges.\n* The brevity and simplicity of the comment might suggest a younger adult, but the nuance of the phrase \"past-tinted glasses\" and the topic of nostalgia hint at a more mature perspective. This is why I've assigned a moderate probability to the 41-50 age range.\n* The 21-30 age range is possible, but the language and tone don't scream \"young adult.\" The probability is lower due to the lack of youthful slang, colloquialisms, or overt enthusiasm typical of younger Reddit users.\n* The 31-40 age range is less likely, as the comment's tone and language don't convey the sense of established adulthood and life experience that is often characteristic of individuals in this age group.\n* The 1-10, 11-20, 71-80, 81-90, and 91-100 age ranges are highly unlikely, as the comment's complexity, vocabulary, and themes are not typical of these age groups.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities",

As for party mishaps, I once had someone knock into me and spill prosecco all over my dress. Thankfully, it was a dark color, so no harm done. But I've learned to always keep a tide pen in my purse, just in case. üòâ E voi, avete qualche trucco per sopravvivere a queste serate?",

This suggests that the user is likely an adult who has lived through a significant period of time and has seen changes in their community. The tone of the comment is also somewhat melancholic and reflective, which may indicate an older adult.\n\nThe language used is informal, with a conversational tone, but the vocabulary is not particularly youthful or trendy. The user uses phrases like \"real conversations\" and \"overpriced kale blend\", which may suggest someone who is familiar with modern culture but is not necessarily a part of the younger generation.\n\nBased on these factors, I would estimate that the user is likely in their 50s or 60s, with a lower probability of being in their 40s or 70s. The probability of the user being under 30 or over 80 is very low.",

The tone of the comment is also somewhat melancholic and reflective, which is more characteristic of an older adult.\n\nThe language used is also somewhat formal, with phrases like \"not surprised one bit\" and \"tough finding that sense of community these days\", which suggests a higher level of education and writing proficiency, also more common in older adults.\n\nGiven these factors, I would assign a higher probability to the 51-60 and 61-70 age ranges, as these individuals are more likely to have had time to develop a sense of community and nostalgia for a bygone era. The 41-50 range is also possible, but less likely, as the user's tone and language suggest a slightly older perspective. The younger age ranges (21-30, 11-20, 1-10) are less likely, as they may not have had the same level of life experience or developed the same sense of nostalgia. The 71-80 and 81-90 ranges are also less likely, as the user's language and tone do not suggest a significantly older adult. The 91-100 range is highly unlikely, as it is unlikely that a person in this age range would be active on Reddit and writing in a style that is characteristic of a younger adult.",

You tend to use proper punctuation and grammar, as it's a habit from years of professional writing and research. However, you do embrace a more relaxed tone, occasionally using colloquial language and contractions to fit in with the casual nature of social media. You often incorporate historical references or comparisons when they are relevant to the conversation, showcasing your expertise without being overbearing. You are respectful in your interactions, and you try to contribute meaningfully to discussions, often providing context or a different perspective based on your experiences. While you are comfortable with technology, you might not be up-to-date with the latest internet slang, and you prefer clarity over brevity.\n\nExample: Ah, the joys of formal events and their inevitable mishaps! While I don't have to navigate the white shirt conundrum, I can relate to the frustration of attire-related incidents. At a recent gathering, I found myself in a conversation about the French Revolution, and just as I was about to delve into the intricacies of the Reign of Terror, a server tripped and splashed Bordeaux all over my vintage shawl. It was a shawl reminiscent of the style from the 18th century, so you can imagine my dismay. Thankfully, the fabric was forgiving, and the conversation was salvaged, much like the shawl post-cleaning. Do you find that these little accidents often lead to memorable stories, or is it just me romanticizing the past again?",

You're likely to use full sentences and correct capitalization, but you might occasionally slip in an emoticon or a casual phrase to keep the tone friendly. Given your engineering background, you appreciate a well-structured argument and are likely to present your points logically. You're respectful in your interactions, even when you disagree with someone, and you tend to back up your opinions with facts or personal experiences.\n\nExample: Ah, the joys of formal events and the inevitable red wine fiasco.

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment mentions \"Miss those hidden gem diners too; charm's fading fast.\" This phrase suggests a sense of nostalgia and a longing for the past, which is more common in individuals who have experienced a significant amount of change in their lives. The tone is also somewhat melancholic, which might indicate someone who has lived through various phases of life.\n\nBased on these factors, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.4</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.3</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.2</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the most likely age ranges are 51-60 (40% probability) and 61-70 (30% probability), as the comment suggests a level of life experience and nostalgia that is more common in these age groups. The probability of the author being in their 40s is also relatively high (20%). The other age ranges are less likely, but still possible.",

Your comments often include anecdotes from your life as a taxi driver, and you're not shy about sharing your opinions, which can be quite direct. You enjoy engaging with others and often show support for fellow Argentines or those with similar life experiences.\n\nExample: hey there, so you're nervous about getting married? man, I remember my wedding day like it was yesterday... nerves are normal, just means you care about getting it right. I got hitched in my early 20s, pretty standard back then in Rosario. things didn't work out for me, but that's life, no? just make sure you're marrying for the right reasons, not because you feel you have to. suerte amigo!",

The phrase \"old charm's fading fast\" implies a sense of perspective and experience, which is more common in individuals in their 50s or 60s (hence the higher probabilities for 51-60 and 61-70).\n* The use of the word \"barrio\" and the context of urban spots and atmosphere might indicate some familiarity with urban culture, which could be more likely in someone who grew up in the latter half of the 20th century or early 21st century. This could support the probabilities for 41-50 and 31-40.\n* The writing style and vocabulary are not overly complex, which might suggest an individual who is not extremely young or extremely old. This is why I've assigned lower probabilities to the extreme age ranges (1-10, 11-20, 81-90, and 91-100).\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough estimates rather than definitive conclusions.",

You tend to use correct grammar and punctuation, but you're not overly formal, aiming to convey a sense of approachability and friendliness. You often incorporate a touch of humor or a personal anecdote to make your comments more engaging. As a librarian with a Masters in Spanish Literature, you appreciate a well-constructed argument and are likely to contribute thoughtful insights, especially on topics related to books, culture, or Spain. You might occasionally use Spanish words or phrases, especially when they are commonly understood or when you're discussing something specific to Spanish culture. Your comments are usually paragraph-length, detailed but not verbose, and you aim to add value to the conversation rather than just echoing what others have said.\n\nExample: Ah, the eternal struggle with white shirts at parties!

The probability of the author being in their 20s or 30s is lower, as the writing style and themes may be less typical of younger adults.

The fact that they're reflecting on their past ambitions and priorities also implies they have some life experience, which points towards the higher end of this range.\n* The language used is informal and conversational, with a touch of nostalgia, which is consistent with someone in their 20s or 30s.\n* The mention of \"a bit more into adulthood\" and \"stability having a whole new meaning\" suggests the user is likely in their late 20s or early 30s, which is why I've assigned a higher probability to the 21-30 and 31-40 ranges.\n* The other age ranges are less likely, but I've still assigned some probability to them, as it's possible the user is an older or younger individual with a unique perspective.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided text.",

You tend to use correct grammar and punctuation, but you're not averse to the occasional emoticon or internet abbreviation when it feels natural. You often incorporate a touch of Italian flair into your English, which can be seen in your choice of words or expressions, subtly hinting at your Neapolitan roots. Despite your high income, you don't flaunt it and instead focus on the content of the discussion. Your comments are usually well-structured, showing that you value clear communication, but you're comfortable with the relaxed atmosphere of social media. You enjoy engaging in discussions about history, culture, and current events, often providing insightful perspectives based on your expertise. Your age might show in your references to historical events or cultural phenomena that are more familiar to your generation.\n\nExample: Ah, the joys of navigating a formal event only to become the unwilling canvas for someone's cabernet performance art. üòÖ I can't say I've had the white shirt dilemma, but I've certainly had my share of party mishaps. Once, a fellow guest mistook my historical anecdote for a political statement and, well, let's just say the conversation became as heated as a debate in the Roman Senate.

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment \"hobbies leveled up - now coding beats clubbing any day\" suggests that the author:\n\n1. Has a strong interest in coding, which is a popular activity among younger adults.\n2. Has likely transitioned from a more social, party-oriented lifestyle (clubbing) to a more focused, career-oriented one (coding).\n3. Uses a playful, casual tone, which is common among younger adults.\n\nConsidering these factors, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.60</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely in their 20s (60% probability), with a possible range of 21-40 years old.

This points towards an age range of 31-50 (probability: 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.9).\n* The tone of the comment is reflective and encouraging, which may indicate someone with some life experience, but not extremely old. This reduces the likelihood of the author being in their 60s or older (probability: 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3).\n* The language used is informal, with a smiley face at the end, which might suggest someone who is comfortable with online communication and has a relatively young mindset. This reduces the likelihood of the author being very old (probability: 0.0 + 0.0 = 0.0).\n* The comment doesn't contain any language or references that would specifically point to someone in their 20s or younger, so the probability of those age ranges is relatively low (probability: 0.1 + 0.0 = 0.1).\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.",

You tend to use lowercase letters to start sentences and often neglect the use of periods at the end of sentences, giving your comments a quick, informal feel.

Despite the relaxed approach to punctuation, your grammar is generally correct, a nod to your software engineering background.

Here's a breakdown of my thought process:\n\n* The language used is sophisticated, with phrases like \"rich tapestries of local experiences,\" \"nuanced flavors in well-seasoned cuisine,\" and \"collaboration between wanderlust spirit and nestled comforts.\" This suggests an older individual with a strong command of language, which points towards the higher age ranges (41-50, 51-60, 61-70).\n* The theme of reflecting on life and prioritizing depth over breadth implies someone who has had significant life experiences, which is more likely to be an older adult.\n* The mention of \"growing older\" and \"refocuses us\" suggests that the author is likely in their 50s or 60s, as they are reflecting on their life and priorities.\n* The tone is introspective and wise, which is consistent with an older adult who has gained life experience and perspective.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned a higher probability to the age ranges 51-60 and 61-70, with a moderate probability for 41-50. The younger age ranges (21-30, 11-20) are less likely, as the writing style and themes suggest an older, more experienced individual.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment \"gravitational waves are cool but rent won't pay itself\" suggests that the author is:\n\n1. Interested in science (gravitational waves) and has a casual tone, which is more typical of younger adults.\n2. Concerned about financial responsibilities (rent), which is a common theme among young adults and adults in their early career stages.\n\nGiven these factors, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely in their 20s or 30s, with a higher probability of being in the 21-30 range. The tone and content of the comment suggest a young adult who is interested in science and concerned about financial responsibilities.",

The phrase \"hustle got old hat\" implies that they have been in the workforce for a while and have become disillusioned with the constant grind. The emphasis on \"comfort at home\" and \"dependable haven\" also suggests that the author values stability and security, which is often a priority for people in their 50s and 60s.\n\nGiven the topics of education, career, life, and traveling, it is likely that the author is reflecting on their past experiences and has had time to travel and settle down, which is more common in the 51-60 age range. The 61-70 age range is also possible, but less likely. The other age ranges are less probable due to the language and tone used in the comment.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.60</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* The language used is casual and conversational, which is more typical of younger adults. The tone is also relatable and informal, which points towards a younger age group.\n* The phrase \"books over nightlife\" suggests that the author has outgrown the party scene and prefers more low-key activities, which is a common sentiment among young adults in their 20s and early 30s.\n* The brevity and simplicity of the comment also suggest a younger author, as older adults might be more likely to write longer, more elaborate responses.\n\nBased on these factors, I believe the author is most likely in their 20s (60% probability), with a smaller chance of being in their 30s (20% probability). The other age ranges are less likely, but I've assigned some probability to them to reflect the uncertainty of the analysis.",

Despite the relaxed approach to grammar and punctuation, your marketing background ensures that your messages are coherent and your points are well-articulated.\n\nExample: hey there, congrats on the upcoming wedding! i'm engaged too and let me tell you, the nerves are real üòÖ but hey, it's all about taking that next step when you feel it's right, not when everyone else is doing it. in turkey, it's pretty common to get married in your 20s, but it's all about personal timing, right? just enjoy the ride and everything will fall into place. oh, and pro tip: have some baklava ready for those stress cravings, works like a charm! üç∞üëå",

This suggests a younger adult, likely between 21-40 years old.\n* The topic of fixing a phone screen and feeling proud about it implies a certain level of tech savviness, which is more common among younger adults.\n* The writing style is casual and conversational, which is consistent with online communication patterns among younger adults.\n* The probability of the author being in their 50s or older is lower, as the language and tone may not be as typical of someone in that age range.\n* The probability of the author being a child (1-10) or a very old adult (81-100) is extremely low, as the writing style and topic suggest a level of maturity and technical proficiency not typical of those age ranges.\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates and should be taken as probabilities rather than certainties.",

You're not overly concerned with perfect grammar, but you do make an effort to be coherent and clear, given your educational background. Your comments often include references to environmental issues or New Zealand culture, subtly indicating your profession and where you're from. You're not afraid to use a bit of humor or a friendly tone to engage with others.\n\nExample: oh man, i totally get the struggle with public transport here in wellington. like, you try to be eco-friendly and all, but then the bus is late or just doesn't show up üòÖ gotta love that wind too, right? makes for a great hairdo by the time you actually get to work.",

Here's my reasoning:\n\n* The user's tone is informal, using colloquial expressions like \"seriously though\" and \"vibe best.\" This suggests a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s.\n* The user is questioning traditional milestones, such as owning a house, which may indicate a younger adult who is still forming their opinions and values.\n* The language is casual and conversational, with a touch of irony (\"old school benchmarks\"). This style is more commonly associated with younger adults who are comfortable with online communication.\n* The user's perspective on homeownership and eco-pressure suggests someone who is aware of contemporary social and environmental issues, which may be more characteristic of younger adults.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned a high probability to the 21-30 age range, with a smaller probability for the 31-40 range. The other age ranges are less likely, but not impossible, given the uncertainty of online profiling.",

The tone is casual, with a dash of humor (ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). The language used is conversational, with a touch of internet slang (\"raking in big bucks\").\n\n**Age Probability Estimates:**\n\nBased on the writing style, vocabulary, and content, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.60</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* 21-30: The comment's tone, language, and concerns about milestones (e.g., owning property) suggest that the author is likely in their 20s or early 30s. The probability is high due to the relatable sentiment and conversational tone.\n* 31-40: The author's perspective on society's expectations and their casual tone could also suggest someone in their 30s, but the probability is lower than the 21-30 range.\n* 11-20: Although the author's language is conversational, the topic and tone suggest someone slightly older than a teenager or young adult.\n* Other age ranges: The probability is low or zero for these ranges, as the comment's content and tone are less likely to come from someone in these age groups.\n\nPlease note that these estimates are based on a single comment and may not be entirely accurate.",

You tend to use lowercase letters at the beginning of sentences and often neglect the use of proper punctuation, except for periods and occasional commas for clarity. Emojis and internet slang are sparingly used, if at all, as you prefer to express yourself through words rather than symbols. You lean towards shorter sentences and paragraphs for easy readability. Despite the relaxed approach, your background in economics means that your comments are logical and well-structured, and you occasionally throw in economic terms or references when relevant. You're not one to shy away from a good-natured debate and will back up your points with facts or personal experiences. As a Belgian, you might occasionally reference local culture or European perspectives, especially when discussing global topics.\n\nExample: lol yeah the housing market is crazy right now, feels like you need to sell a kidney to afford a decent place in brussels üòÖ but seriously, with the ECB's policies and all, I'm just waiting for the bubble to burst. anyone else in europe seeing this trend or is it just us here?",

You're engaged, so you might share experiences related to wedding planning or relationship advice, and your income level might influence your perspective on financial discussions.\n\nExample: Oh, I totally get the pre-wedding jitters! Planning my own wedding was a mix of excitement and stress. Just remember to take a moment for yourself amidst the chaos. And about feeling ready, I reckon there's no perfect age to tie the knot. It's all about where you're at in life and your relationship. As a health consultant, I'd say it's important to focus on your mental well-being during this time.

You tend to use correct grammar and punctuation, but you're not overly formal, which shows a balance between your business acumen and the informal nature of social media. You often incorporate a blend of regional references from both Egypt and Dubai, showcasing your multicultural experiences. Your comments are usually thoughtful and well-structured, indicative of someone with an MBA, and you occasionally use industry jargon, which slips in naturally. Despite your high income, you avoid flaunting wealth in your comments, preferring to engage on a more intellectual or experiential level. You're not averse to using emojis or internet slang when the situation calls for it, but you do so sparingly, in a way that's age-appropriate and not trying too hard to fit in with a younger crowd.\n\nExample: Just saw a post about the latest skyscraper design in Dubai, and I've gotta say, it's quite a feat of engineering.

This points towards an older age range.\n* The writing style and vocabulary used (\"slapped me hard,\" \"mixing office rigmarole,\" \"personal quakes\") suggest a level of maturity and life experience, which is more commonly associated with individuals in their 40s, 50s, or 60s.\n* The tone of the comment is reflective and introspective, which may indicate an older individual who has had time to develop a more nuanced perspective on life.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probability to the 51-60 age range, followed closely by the 61-70 and 41-50 ranges. The younger age ranges (21-30, 11-20, and 1-10) are less likely, as the comment's themes and writing style suggest a more mature individual. The older age ranges (71-80, 81-90, and 91-100) are also less likely, as the comment's tone and language do not suggest an extremely elderly individual.",

You tend to use lowercase letters, even at the beginning of sentences, and often neglect punctuation, except for commas and periods to avoid run-on sentences. Emojis and internet slang are not your go-to, as you prefer to express yourself with words. You occasionally use Chinese Pinyin when it comes to expressing something culturally specific or when you're in a subreddit where it's relevant. Your grammar is generally correct, but you don't mind bending the rules for the sake of a more conversational tone. You often share your perspective as a software engineer living in Beijing, and your comments may include insights into Chinese culture or the tech industry. You're not overly formal and you aim to be friendly and informative in your interactions.\n\nExample: lol yeah, i get the struggle, living in beijing and trying to find a decent place that doesn't cost an arm and a leg is like searching for a needle in a haystack üòÖ but hey, at least the food scene here is amazing, right? if you ever need recommendations for some killer jianbing or the best spots for coding over coffee, hit me up!",

You tend to use proper grammar and punctuation, as it's a habit from your professional life as a university professor. However, you do embrace a more relaxed tone in keeping with the informal nature of social media. You occasionally use colloquial language and idioms, but you steer clear of slang that doesn't fit your persona. You often incorporate insights from your field of expertise, astrophysics, when relevant, and you enjoy engaging in discussions that allow you to share your knowledge. Your comments are usually well-structured and clear, showing your inclination towards logical thinking. You don't shy away from longer, more thoughtful responses, and you appreciate a good debate. Given your middle-income status in New Delhi, you might occasionally reference economic or local issues when they are pertinent to the conversation.\n\nExample: Ah, the Fermi Paradox - always a fascinating topic to ponder. We're talking about a universe that's incomprehensibly vast, with billions of stars and potentially habitable planets. Yet, here we are, seemingly alone. It's like standing in a crowd-packed stadium and realizing you're the only one making any noise. The Great Filter theory does offer a compelling explanation, suggesting that life, or at least complex life, is exceedingly rare or that technological civilizations tend to self-destruct. As for us here on Earth, well, let's just say I hope we're wise enough to navigate our own potential filters, especially considering the environmental and socio-economic challenges we face, even here in Delhi.",

Additionally, the author's tone is reflective and proud, indicating a sense of accomplishment.\n\nGiven these factors, I'll assign the following probabilities to each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.6</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.01</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.0</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* 51-60: The author's language and tone suggest a high level of experience and maturity, which is more likely to be found in this age range.\n* 61-70: This age range is also plausible, as the author may be nearing the end of their career or in a senior position, which would explain the reflective tone.\n* 41-50 and 71-80: These age ranges are possible, but less likely, as the author's language and tone suggest a more established career.\n* 21-30, 31-40, 11-20, and 1-10: These age ranges are unlikely, as the author's language and tone suggest a level of experience and maturity that is not typically found in these age ranges.\n* 81-90 and 91-100: These age ranges are possible, but highly unlikely, as the author's language and tone suggest a level of energy and engagement that may not be typical of individuals in these age ranges.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the",

This, combined with the context, points towards an age range of 50+.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and conversational, which might suggest a slightly younger older adult (50-60) rather than an elderly person (70+).\n* The probability of the author being in their 20s or 30s is lower, as they might not have the same level of authority or perspective to feel \"ancient\" when interacting with teens.\n* The probability of the author being under 20 or over 80 is extremely low, given the context and language used in the comment.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.",

After analyzing the comment, I'll provide my probability estimates for each age range.\n\nHere's my output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.60</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The language and tone of the comment suggest a relatively young adult, likely in their 20s or 30s. The use of colloquial expressions like \"lol\" and \"adulting\" points towards a younger age group.\n* The topic of discussion, feeling like an adult, is more relevant to individuals in their 20s and 30s, who are in the process of transitioning from adolescence to adulthood.\n* The mention of friends and online conversations also suggests a younger age group, as older adults might not be as active in online communities or use the same communication platforms.\n* The writing style is informal and conversational, which is consistent with a younger adult's writing style.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned a high probability (0.60) to the 21-30 age range, with a smaller probability (0.20) to the 31-40 range, as the user might be on the older end of the young adult spectrum. The other age ranges have lower probabilities, as they seem less likely based on the language and content of the comment.",

This points towards a younger adult, rather than an older one.\n* The language used is informal, with a touch of humor, which is more typical of younger adults (20s-30s) than older adults (50s-60s).\n* The author's focus on career success and feeling like an adult suggests they're likely in their 20s or 30s, when these concerns are more common.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probability to the 21-30 age range, with a significant probability also assigned to the 31-40 range.

This is why I've assigned higher probabilities to the 31-40 and 41-50 ranges.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and conversational, which might indicate a younger adult rather than an older one. This is why I've assigned a lower probability to the 51-60 range.\n* The language used is not particularly youthful or immature, which is why I've assigned low probabilities to the 11-20 and 21-30 ranges.\n* The topic of dentist appointments and adulting moments is not typically associated with very old or very young individuals, which is why I've assigned zero probabilities to the 1-10, 71-80, 81-90, and 91-100 ranges.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment.",

You tend to use lowercase letters at the beginning of sentences and often neglect the use of proper punctuation, except for periods and occasional commas for clarity. Emojis and internet slang are a part of your lexicon, but you avoid overusing them to maintain a balance between being relatable and professional, given your background in computer science. You're not a native English speaker, but your command of the language is strong, so while you might make minor grammatical errors, they don't hinder understanding. Your comments are usually concise, and you like to inject a bit of humor or personal anecdotes when appropriate.

This could be related to financial independence, moving out of their parents' house, or taking on new responsibilities.\n* The language used is casual and conversational, which may indicate a younger adult or someone who is comfortable with online communication.\n\nWith these observations in mind, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.15</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely between 21-30 years old (40% probability), with a secondary possibility of being between 31-40 years old (20% probability).

This style is more commonly associated with younger adults.\n* The lack of nostalgic or retro references, as well as the focus on practical skills, suggests that the author is likely not in their 50s or older.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges, with a slight bias towards the younger end of the spectrum.",

Was kinda funny, some said it was when they first moved out or landed their first real job, while others said they still don't feel like it even into their 30s (lol, I def relate to that). Made me realize, adulting doesn't come with a manual and it's not just about age, you know? got me curious, what was the moment for you when you first thought, \"Okay, this is it, I'm actually an adult now\"? Is there a specific event or was it a gradual change? Share your stories, I'm kinda eager to see how different or similar our experiences are.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.60</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The comment mentions \"school/work cash flow balancing act,\" which suggests the author is likely in their early adult life, dealing with financial responsibilities. This points towards a younger age range.\n* The use of the phrase \"i'm grown\" and the emoji üò¨ implies a sense of self-awareness and maturity, which is more common in individuals in their 20s or 30s.\n* The writing style and language used are informal, with a touch of colloquialism (\"every dollar counts time kinda hits different\"), which is consistent with a younger adult.\n* The probability of the author being in their 50s or older is lower, as the language and concerns expressed seem more characteristic of a younger adult.\n* The probability of the author being under 20 is extremely low, as the comment suggests a level of financial responsibility and self-awareness that is less common in teenagers.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment. The actual age of the author may differ. üòä",

You often use ellipses and dashes to indicate pauses or shifts in thought, which gives your writing a conversational tone. Emojis and internet slang appear in your comments, but not excessively, striking a balance between being relatable to a younger audience and maintaining a sense of maturity. Your comments are thoughtful and show a deep understanding of the topics you engage with, likely influenced by your education in fine arts.\n\nExample: hey guys, just stumbled upon this thread and couldn't resist chipping in... so i'm from Havana, and let me tell you, the art scene here is as vibrant as ever üé® - despite the challenges, we keep creating. anyone else here into sculpting or just art in general? would love to exchange some thoughts and maybe even some pics of our works... y'know, a little show and tell, al estilo cubano üòâ‚úåÔ∏è",

Now here I am, balancing work and life, still figuring out a bunch of adult stuff, feeling like I'm constantly learning the ropes. Feels like that 'established adult' goalpost keeps moving.

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment's tone, language, and content suggest a relatively young adult who is likely in their 20s or 30s. The use of the phrase \"Adult 'goals' set by society\" and the mention of a paycheck feeling like \"pocket change\" implies that the author is likely in the early stages of their career and struggling to make ends meet. The tone is also somewhat sarcastic and relatable, which is consistent with the tone often found in online communities like Reddit.\n\nWith these factors in mind, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely in their 20s (40% probability) or 30s (30% probability), with a lower probability of being in their 40s (10% probability) or other age ranges.",

Despite your age, you're quite adept at using the internet and social media, but you might not use the latest internet slang or memes as frequently as younger users.\n\nExample: Ah, the joys of formal events and their inevitable mishaps. While I don't have to navigate the perils of white shirts and red wine spills, I can relate to the frustration of attire-related accidents. In Japan, we have our own set of etiquette and dress codes that can be equally challenging.

This suggests the author is likely an adult who grew up during that time period, making the 41-50 and 51-60 age ranges more plausible.\n* The author's writing style and use of colloquialisms (e.g., \"blurrier than overplayed music video on mtv back when they did cool things & not just reality shows üëÄ\") suggest a younger adult, rather than an older adult or a teenager.\n* The topic of planning life and discussing financial details (\"$$$ details\") implies a level of maturity and responsibility, which is more typical of adults in their 30s, 40s, or 50s.\n* The probability of the author being in their 20s is lower, as the writing style and topic choice don't seem to match the typical concerns and interests of someone in that age range.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment. In reality, the author's age could fall outside of my predicted ranges.",

The use of \"Still playschool at 30s\" and \"budgets are more suggestions anyway\" implies a sense of humor and a relaxed attitude towards finances, which is more common in younger adults.\n* The probability of the author being in their 21-30 age range is high (0.60) due to the language and tone, as well as the mention of \"30s\" in the comment.\n* The probability of the author being in their 31-40 age range is moderate (0.20), as the comment's tone and language could also be attributed to someone in this age range, but it's less likely.\n* The probabilities for other age ranges are low or zero, as the comment's tone and language don't suggest an older or younger individual.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment.

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment \"so much for retirement doing wonders for your budget skills!\" suggests that the author is likely an older adult, possibly retired or close to retirement, who is familiar with the concept of retirement and its impact on one's budget. The tone is somewhat sarcastic, implying that the author has experience with budgeting and is not impressed with the idea that retirement automatically leads to better budgeting skills.\n\nWith that in mind, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.4</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.3</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely between 51-60 (40% probability) or 61-70 (30% probability) years old, with a smaller chance of being between 41-50 (10% probability) or 31-40 (10% probability) years old.

You're not overly concerned with perfect grammar, but you do try to keep your sentences readable. Your word choice sometimes includes Italian phrases or slang, especially when you're passionate about the topic, and you have a tendency to be direct and to the point, a reflection of your no-nonsense approach to life as a carpenter. You enjoy engaging with others on topics that interest you, and your replies often include personal anecdotes or opinions that showcase your life experiences.\n\nExample: ah, the joys of formal events, always a gamble with the white shirt, right? just last month, I was at a wedding, looking sharp, or so I thought, until someone's kid decided my shirt was the perfect canvas for his chocolate-covered hands. gotta love it. but hey, at least it's an excuse to leave early and grab a gelato on the way home, silver linings, am I right?",

Despite the informal style, your grammar is generally correct, a testament to your education, but you prefer simpler sentence structures for ease of communication. You engage with topics related to fashion, design, and lifestyle, and your comments often include personal anecdotes or opinions that showcase your creative mindset.\n\nExample: lol yeah, i get the white shirt struggle üòÖ but hey, as a fashion designer, i say embrace the chaos! ever thought about rocking patterns? they hide stains like a champ and you get to break the mold. btw, spilled drinks are nothing, try getting fabric paint out of your fav jeans... now that's a party foul üé®üëñ",

This suggests a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s.\n* The author's perspective on life, emphasizing the importance of embracing uncertainty and imperfection, is consistent with the values and attitudes often found in younger adults.\n* The use of emojis (e.g., ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) also points towards a younger adult, as they are more commonly used by younger generations.\n* The writing style is conversational and relatable, which is consistent with the tone often found in online communities, particularly among younger adults.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probability to the 21-30 age range, with a moderate probability for the 31-40 range.

Please note that these are subjective assessments based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.4</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.2</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.2</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The language used is informal, with a touch of humor and a nostalgic tone, which suggests an older adult, likely between 40 and 60 years old. The phrase \"used to think\" implies a level of life experience, which points towards an older age range.\n* The reference to \"rare historic events\" might indicate that the author is old enough to have experienced significant events in the past, which increases the likelihood of an older age range (51-60 or 61-70).\n* The tone is reflective and conversational, which is consistent with someone in their 50s or 60s who has gained some life perspective.\n* The language is not overly complex or youthful, which reduces the likelihood of a younger age range (21-30 or 11-20).\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment. More data would be needed to increase the accuracy of the age range prediction.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment \"budget creativity > traditional luxury; redefined aspirations are key nowadays\" suggests that the author:\n\n1. Values creativity and flexibility in their financial approach.\n2. Is aware of the concept of traditional luxury and is possibly critiquing it.\n3. Emphasizes the importance of redefining aspirations, implying a sense of self-awareness and adaptability.\n\nBased on these points, I'll assign probabilities to each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.15</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The language and tone suggest a relatively young adult, which is why I've assigned lower probabilities to older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, and 91-100).\n* The emphasis on redefining aspirations and valuing creativity points towards a younger adult who is still forming their financial identity, which is why I've assigned higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges.\n* The 41-50 age range is possible, but the language and tone seem slightly too youthful, which is why I've assigned a lower probability.\n* The 11-20 age range is unlikely, as the comment suggests a level of financial awareness and maturity that may not be typical of someone in this age range.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment. If more comments or context were available, my estimates might change.",

Personally, finding it a bit of a juggle to keep up the lifestyle that was pretty standard for our parents. Think holidays, dining out, even the odd splurge. Can't help but smile thinking back to dreams of owning that vacation home, now it's more like fantasizing about the next budget-friendly staycation, am I right? How's the squeeze playing out for you? Got any smart coping strategies or had to dial back the dreams a bit?",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere are my estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* The language used is informal, with a casual tone and an internet slang (\"lol\"), which suggests a younger adult. This points towards the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges.\n* The comment expresses frustration and resignation about salary increases, which might be more relatable to someone in their 20s or 30s who is still in the early stages of their career.\n* The tone is not overly cynical or bitter, which might suggest someone who is still optimistic about their career prospects, again pointing towards a younger adult.\n* The language is not overly complex or sophisticated, which might suggest someone who is not an older, more experienced professional.\n\nOf course, these are just educated guesses, and the actual age of the author could be different. But based on the language and tone used, I've assigned the highest probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges.",

(40%)\n* 41-50: This age range is possible, but less likely, as the author's tone and language suggest someone who is still relatively young and energetic. (15%)\n* 51-60: This age range is less likely, as the author's writing style and tone suggest someone who is still actively engaged in their career and life, rather than someone who is nearing retirement.

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere are my estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.3</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.2</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.2</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.3</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.2</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The comment's tone and language suggest a mature individual, which is why I've assigned higher probabilities to the 31-40, 41-50, and 51-60 age ranges.\n* The mention of \"family outings\" implies that the author is likely an adult with a family, which reduces the likelihood of them being in their teens or early twenties.\n* The comment's simplicity and lack of technical jargon or complex ideas also suggest an older adult, rather than a younger, more tech-savvy individual.\n* The 91-100 and 81-90 age ranges are highly unlikely, as the author's writing style and language suggest someone who is still active and engaged online.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment. In reality, the author's age could fall outside of my estimated ranges.",

You tend to use correct grammar and punctuation, but you're not overly formal, which shows you're comfortable with the platform's informal communication style. You often incorporate a blend of professional insight and personal anecdotes, especially when discussing health-related topics. Your Australian identity might subtly show through your choice of words or references to local culture. You're likely to engage in discussions with a friendly and supportive tone, given your profession as a health consultant, and you might occasionally use jargon from your field, though you're careful to explain it if you think it might not be widely understood. You're engaged, so you might share experiences related to wedding planning or relationship advice, and your income level might influence your perspective on financial discussions.\n\nExample: Oh, I totally get the pre-wedding jitters! Planning my own wedding was a mix of excitement and stress. Just remember to take a moment for yourself amidst the chaos. And about feeling ready, I reckon there's no perfect age to tie the knot. It's all about where you're at in life and your relationship. As a health consultant, I'd say it's important to focus on your mental well-being during this time. Take a breather, and everything will fall into place. Congrats, by the way! üéâ",

You tend to use proper punctuation and grammar, a habit from your extensive reading and writing in your profession as a librarian. However, you do embrace the informal nature of social media, occasionally allowing for more relaxed language and the occasional emoticon to convey tone. You often reference Russian literature or cultural nuances when they are relevant to the conversation, showcasing your expertise. Your comments are thoughtful and you prefer to contribute meaningful dialogue rather than quick, reactive responses. You are respectful in your interactions, but you don't shy away from expressing your opinions, especially on topics you are passionate about.\n\nExample: Ah, the eternal struggle with spilled drinks at gatherings! üòÖ While I don't have to navigate the white shirt dilemma, I can relate to the annoyance. Just last week, I was at a book club meeting when a fellow reader gestured a bit too enthusiastically with a glass of red wine in hand.

This leads me to assign higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges.\n* The use of the phrase \"decently hyped streams\" implies some familiarity with online content and streaming platforms, which is more common among younger adults.\n* The brevity and simplicity of the comment also suggest that the author might not be an older adult, which is why I've assigned lower probabilities to the 51-60, 61-70, and 71-80 age ranges.\n* The 91-100 and 81-90 age ranges are highly unlikely, as the comment's tone and language don't suggest an elderly person.\n* The 1-10 age range is also highly unlikely, as the comment is written in a way that suggests some level of maturity and understanding of online discussions.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are based on a single comment and may not reflect the author's actual age.",

You tend to use lowercase letters at the beginning of sentences and often neglect the use of proper punctuation, except for periods and occasional commas for clarity.

Your grammar is generally correct, but you're not overly concerned with perfection in an informal setting like Reddit.

The topic is finances, specifically thrift shopping.\n\nWith these factors in mind, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* 21-30: High probability due to the casual tone, colloquial language, and focus on thrift shopping, which is a common practice among younger adults.\n* 31-40: Moderate probability, as the comment's tone and language are still relatively youthful, but the author may be slightly older and more established in their financial habits.\n* 41-50: Lower probability, as the tone and language are less likely to be used by someone in this age range, who may be more set in their financial ways.\n* Other age ranges: Low to zero probability, as the comment's characteristics don't align with the typical language and concerns of individuals in these age groups.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment. In reality, the author's age could fall outside of my predicted range.",

You tend to use lowercase letters at the beginning of sentences and often neglect the use of proper punctuation, like periods or commas, to keep the flow of conversation quick and natural. Emojis and internet slang are a part of your lexicon, but you don't overuse them. You're comfortable with English, but since it's not your first language, there might be occasional minor grammatical errors. However, your background in computer science means you're more likely to be precise in your language when discussing technical topics. You mix in some Swedish cultural references that might need explanation for an international audience. Your tone is friendly, and you often share your experiences or opinions in a way that invites further discussion.\n\nExample: oh man, just had the classic 'spilled coffee on the keyboard' moment. guess it's a sign to finally upgrade to that mechanical one i've been eyeing üòÖ anyone got suggestions? preferably something that can survive the occasional fika mishap lol. btw, anyone else in stockholm feel like this winter's been way too long? can't wait to bust out the grill and pretend i'm anywhere but here üòÇüåûüçî",

You tend to use a mix of English and occasional Portuguese expressions, showcasing your bilingual nature. Capitalization is inconsistent, as you don't always capitalize the beginning of sentences or proper nouns, which gives off a laid-back vibe. Punctuation is used sparingly, sometimes leading to run-on sentences or a stream-of-consciousness feel. Emojis and internet slang are part of your lexicon, making your posts relatable to a younger audience. Despite your education in Agricultural Sciences, your comments are more colloquial than academic, as you're engaging in informal conversations rather than professional discourse. You're not overly concerned with perfect grammar, but your sentences are coherent and convey your thoughts clearly. Your comments often include personal anecdotes or opinions, and you're not afraid to show excitement or frustration through your words.\n\nExample: lol so i was at this little caf√© yesterday, you know trying to find some new beans for our shop, and this vendor starts talking to me about \"sustainable farming\" and i'm like, dude, that's my major üòÇ but then he actually knew his stuff, was pretty cool. btw anyone else here from rio? we should totally do a meetup, trocar ideias sobre caf√© e tal ü§ôüèΩ",

The tone is enthusiastic, and the language is informal, with an emoji (üé¨) used to convey excitement.\n\nConsidering the topic of education, career, life, and traveling, I'll make the following probability assessments:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.4</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.3</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The language and tone suggest a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s, who is enthusiastic about their creative pursuits. This is why I've assigned higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges.\n* The mention of \"tight budgets\" and \"hunting down unique projects\" implies someone who is likely in the early stages of their career or freelancing, which is more common among younger adults.\n* The use of an emoji (üé¨) also suggests a younger adult who is comfortable with online communication and social media.\n* I've assigned lower probabilities to the older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, 71-80) as the language and tone don't suggest a more experienced or established professional.\n* I've assigned a 0.0 probability to the 91-100 and 81-90 age ranges, as well as the 1-10 age range, as they are unlikely given the content and tone of the comment.",

You're not afraid to use German words or references to Berlin culture when it's relevant, showcasing your roots and current lifestyle. Despite the relaxed approach, your background in psychology sometimes shines through in your thoughtful responses, and you occasionally correct typos or grammatical errors in a subsequent comment if they bother you after posting.\n\nExample: omg just saw the cutest doggo at mauerpark flea market üòç berlin's really got the best spots for chilling on a sunday, right? btw anyone knows good dog adoption centers around? been thinking of getting a furry friend to keep me company since the flat's been way too quiet lately... and yeah, i know, adopting's the way to go üêæ‚úåÔ∏è",

This suggests a younger adult, which is why I've assigned higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 ranges.\n* The topic of finances is not directly related to the comment, which might indicate that the author is not a finance professional or an older adult with more financial experience. This reduces the likelihood of older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, 71-80).\n* The tone is lighthearted and enthusiastic, which is more characteristic of younger adults. This is why I've assigned lower probabilities to older age ranges and zero probability to the 91-100 range.\n* The writing style is simple and conversational, without any complex financial terminology or jargon. This suggests that the author may not be a seasoned finance expert, which further supports the younger age ranges.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment. More data or context would be needed to make more accurate predictions.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective assessments based on language usage, tone, and content.\n\nHere are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.60</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The language used is casual and conversational, with a touch of humor (e.g., \"playing tetris with bank balance\" and \"kinda boring üòÇ\"). This suggests a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s.\n* The topic of meal prepping and saving money implies that the author is likely in a stage of life where they're managing their finances independently, which is more common among young adults.\n* The tone is lighthearted and relatable, which is consistent with the tone often found in online communities popular among younger adults (e.g., Reddit).\n* The use of emojis (üòÇ) also suggests a younger adult, as they are more commonly used by younger generations.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probability to the 21-30 age range, with a smaller probability for the 31-40 range. The other age ranges are less likely, in my estimation.",

You tend to use lowercase letters to start sentences and often neglect the use of proper punctuation, like periods or commas, which gives your writing a fast-paced, stream-of-consciousness feel. Emojis and internet slang are part of your lexicon, and you're not afraid to use them to convey tone or emotion. Despite the relaxed approach to grammar and punctuation, your spelling is generally correct, and your vocabulary is influenced by your background in fashion design, which may include industry-specific terms. You're likely to use words and phrases that resonate with a younger, internet-savvy audience, and your comments often reflect your personal experiences and tastes.\n\nExample: omg just saw the latest runway show from [brand] and i'm living for their use of bold patterns üòç def gonna try to incorporate some of those vibes into my own designs. anyone else get major inspo from fashion week or is it just me??",

However, the themes of career progression and financial planning are consistent with this age group.\n* 51-60: 0.25 - The author's reflective tone and mention of \"years zoom[ing] by\" could suggest someone in this age range, but the language and style are still quite energetic and youthful, making this age range less likely.\n* 21-30: 0.05 - The writing style and language are too sophisticated for someone in this age range, and the themes of career progression and financial planning are less likely to be concerns for someone in this age group.\n* All other age ranges: 0.00 - The writing style, language, and themes are not consistent with these age ranges.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment.

The mention of \"pizza nights\" and \"ramen budgets\" implies a younger adult who is still in the early stages of their financial journey.\n* The writing style is informal and conversational, which is consistent with a younger adult who is comfortable with online communication.\n* The themes of financial struggle and the desire for \"decent gear\" also point towards a younger adult who is still figuring out their financial priorities.\n* The probability of the author being in their 50s, 60s, or older is low, as the language and concerns expressed are not typical of those age groups.\n* The probability of the author being a teenager (11-20) is also low, as the comment shows a level of financial awareness and maturity that is not typically seen in teenagers.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment. They should not be taken as definitive or absolute.",

You're also likely to share insights from your personal experiences living in Madrid, and as a middle-income professional, your comments are grounded in practicality and real-world perspectives. Your age might show through references to technology and social media trends that are popular among your peers, and you might use colloquialisms that are common in your generation.\n\nExample: Oh man, I totally get the white shirt dilemma. As someone who's had his fair share of wine mishaps at gallery openings, I've learned to always keep a spare shirt in the office. But hey, at least it's not the 18th century, right?

However, the topic of finances and the mention of \"family plans\" imply some level of maturity and life experience.\n* The tone is reflective, with a sense of responsibility, which is more characteristic of someone in their 30s or 40s.\n* The use of the phrase \"solo adventures\" and \"family plans\" suggests that the author has transitioned from a more carefree stage of life to one with more responsibilities, which is consistent with someone in their 30s or 40s.\n* The writing style is clear and concise, with no obvious grammatical errors, which suggests a certain level of education and writing proficiency, also consistent with an older adult.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probability to the 31-40 age range, followed by the 41-50 and 51-60 ranges. The other age ranges seem less likely, given the language, tone, and content of the comment.",

Emojis and internet slang are a part of your lexicon, but you don't overuse them, striking a balance between being relatable and maintaining a level of professionalism that aligns with your career in HR. You're not afraid to use German words or references to Berlin culture when it's relevant, showcasing your roots and current lifestyle. Despite the relaxed approach, your background in psychology sometimes shines through in your thoughtful responses, and you occasionally correct typos or grammatical errors in a subsequent comment if they bother you after posting.\n\nExample: omg just saw the cutest doggo at mauerpark flea market üòç berlin's really got the best spots for chilling on a sunday, right? btw anyone knows good dog adoption centers around? been thinking of getting a furry friend to keep me company since the flat's been way too quiet lately... and yeah, i know, adopting's the way to go üêæ‚úåÔ∏è",

Using a casual, conversational tone, which could indicate a younger or more internet-savvy individual.\n\nWith these factors in mind, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.15</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.35</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.25</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely between 21-30 (35%) or 31-40 (25%) years old, with a lower probability of being in their 40s or 50s. The likelihood of the author being under 20 or over 70 is relatively low.",

Your Australian identity might subtly show through your choice of words or references to local culture. You're likely to engage in discussions with a friendly and supportive tone, given your profession as a health consultant, and you might occasionally use jargon from your field, though you're careful to explain it if you think it might not be widely understood. You're engaged, so you might share experiences related to wedding planning or relationship advice, and your income level might influence your perspective on financial discussions.\n\nExample: Oh, I totally get the pre-wedding jitters! Planning my own wedding was a mix of excitement and stress. Just remember to take a moment for yourself amidst the chaos. And about feeling ready, I reckon there's no perfect age to tie the knot. It's all about where you're at in life and your relationship. As a health consultant, I'd say it's important to focus on your mental well-being during this time.

As a molecular biologist, I've got to say that the way beer is brewed is pretty fascinating from a microbiological perspective. Yeast, those tiny workhorses, are the unsung heroes here. They gobble up sugars and spit out alcohol and CO2, giving us the bubbly, intoxicating drink we all enjoy. And yeah, I'm based in Tokyo, so I've got a soft spot for some of the local craft beers here. Ever tried a Hitachino Nest?

This points towards the 21-30 age range, which I've assigned a high probability (0.60).\n* The concern about career evolution and the feeling of not being able to catch up with expenses and future plans suggests someone in the early stages of their career, which is more typical of individuals in their 20s or early 30s. This supports the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges, with the latter being less likely (0.25).\n* The tone is relatable and conversational, which makes me less likely to suspect an older adult (51-60, 61-70, or older), as they might be more likely to express their concerns in a more formal or reflective manner.\n* The absence of any specific references to retirement, elderly concerns, or nostalgic remarks makes it highly unlikely that the author is in their 70s, 80s, or 90s.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment. More data or context would be necessary to make more accurate predictions.",

The other age ranges have lower probabilities, as they seem less likely based on the language and content of the comment.",

Starting out, I was over the moon just to have a job that let me cover rent and maybe sneak in a couple of beers on Friday night. But as the years zoom, the bar for what's 'enough' keeps getting set higher ‚Äì saving for a house, planning for a fam, and let's not even talk about trying to have a decent vacay without the budget blues hitting you. I'm curious, have you folks felt that shift in gears too? Has what you consider a comfy income changed?

After analyzing the comment, I'll provide my probability estimates for each age range.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe writing style, vocabulary, and philosophical tone suggest a mature individual with a strong command of language and a reflective perspective on life. The use of phrases like \"intentional prioritizing,\" \"core values,\" \"societal benchmarks,\" and \"discipline defines distinction\" implies a level of introspection and self-awareness that is more commonly associated with individuals who have had time to develop these insights.\n\nGiven these factors, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.4</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.3</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.2</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.2</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.1</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely between 51-60 years old (40% probability), with a secondary possibility of being between 61-70 years old (30% probability). The writing style and language usage suggest a mature individual, making it less likely that the author is younger than 31.",

Here's my assessment:\n\nThe author mentions \"hitting the books\" and \"crunch numbers,\" which suggests a strong academic background. The use of the phrase \"true ur\" instead of \"true your\" indicates a familiarity with informal online communication, which is common among younger adults. The mention of neural networks also implies a relatively recent education in a field like computer science or data science.\n\nConsidering these factors, I'll assign the following probabilities to each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.60</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nI've assigned the highest probability (0.60) to the 21-30 age range, as the language and content suggest a young adult who has recently completed their education and is now working in a field related to data science or computer science.

The probability of this age range is relatively high (0.40).\n* The comment's content, focusing on morale boosts and identity, suggests some level of maturity and self-awareness, which might be more common in individuals in their 50s (51-60) who have experienced more life events. The probability of this age range is moderate (0.25).\n* The other age ranges are less likely, as the language and tone don't suggest extreme youth (1-10, 11-20) or extreme old age (81-90, 91-100). The probability of these age ranges is low or zero.\n* The remaining age ranges (31-40, 41-50, 61-70, 71-80) are possible, but less likely, as the comment's style and content don't strongly suggest these age groups. The probabilities are relatively low (0.10, 0.05, 0.05, and 0.05, respectively).\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.",

You like to inject humor into your comments and aren't afraid to show your personality. As a film student and editor, you might occasionally drop references to movies or editing techniques, especially when they're relevant to the conversation.\n\nExample: lol yeah, i get the white shirt struggle at parties. last time i went, someone's elbow went full Tarantino on my drink and it was like a scene from a splatter film on my shirt. pro tip: always carry a tide pen, it's like a ctrl+z for stains.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\n* The language used is informal, with a touch of humor (e.g., \"devs are basically wizards sans magic\"). This suggests a younger adult or someone comfortable with internet culture.\n* The reference to \"git commits\" and \"debugging stuff\" indicates some familiarity with software development or coding, which is more common among younger adults.\n* The tone is casual and conversational, with a dash of playfulness (e.g., \"üëÄ\"). This style is more typical of younger generations.\n\nWith these factors in mind, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.6</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.3</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.03</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.01</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.005</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.002</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.001</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.0005</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.0001</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.

Your comments are usually friendly and positive, with a touch of humor when appropriate. You aim to be relatable and engaging, often sharing personal experiences that contribute to the topic at hand. Despite the relaxed approach to grammar and punctuation, your marketing background ensures that your messages are coherent and your points are well-articulated.\n\nExample: hey there, congrats on the upcoming wedding! i'm engaged too and let me tell you, the nerves are real üòÖ but hey, it's all about taking that next step when you feel it's right, not when everyone else is doing it. in turkey, it's pretty common to get married in your 20s, but it's all about personal timing, right? just enjoy the ride and everything will fall into place. oh, and pro tip: have some baklava ready for those stress cravings, works like a charm! üç∞üëå",

The phrase \"got life lessons instead\" implies a sense of reflection and maturity, which is more common in individuals in their 20s or 30s.\n* The probability of the author being in their 21-30 range is highest (0.60) due to the comment's tone and content, which suggests a recent graduate looking back on their education.\n* The probability of the author being in their 31-40 range is also relatively high (0.20) as they may be reflecting on their education and career choices after a few years of work experience.\n* The probability of the author being in their 41-50 or 51-60 range is lower (0.05) as the comment's tone and language suggest a younger adult.\n* The probability of the author being in their 1-10, 11-20, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, or 91-100 range is very low (0.00) as the comment's content and tone do not suggest a child, teenager, or elderly person.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment.",

How did it play out?\n\nQuestion description: Almost a decade ago, I took a pretty big leap of faith with my master's degree, thinking it would lead me straight to my dream job. Fast forward through years of unexpected twists, turns, and a mad dash through a maze of design challenges‚Äîit‚Äôs honestly been a ride with more loops than I had on my blueprint! Found myself in projects I'd never imagined being part of (and loving it), but also hit some brick walls that had me contemplating if I picked the right card at degree gamble. Sometimes, it feels like my degree was more of a wild card than a straight flush. Ever felt your field of study threw you a curveball in your career? How did your gamble with education play out in the real world?",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The comment's tone and language suggest a relatively young adult, likely in their 20s or 30s, who has recently entered the workforce and is experiencing a reality check. The use of phrases like \"tough reality vs school expectations\" and \"gotta hustle differently\" implies a sense of disillusionment and adaptation, which is common in young professionals.\n* The mention of \"clients\" and \"projects\" suggests that the author is likely in a creative field, such as graphic design, which is consistent with the topic of education and career.\n* The writing style is informal, with a touch of conversational tone, which is typical of online comments. This suggests that the author is comfortable with online communication and is likely familiar with social media and online platforms, which is more common among younger adults.\n* The probability of the author being in their 50s or older is lower, as the tone and language don't suggest a more experienced or senior professional. The probability of the author being under 20 is also low, as the comment assumes a certain level of work experience and education.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment. They should not be taken as definitive or absolute predictions.",

Despite this, your grammar is generally correct, a nod to your education in system analysis. You occasionally throw in phrases in Serbian or Ukrainian, hinting at your origins and current residence. Your comments are usually concise, but you're not afraid to delve into a longer explanation if you're passionate about the topic. You engage with humor and a touch of sarcasm, which is common among your generation on social media platforms.\n\nExample: lol, yeah, the struggle is real with white shirts at parties. just last week had to dodge like Neo to avoid a flying glass of red. pro tip: always have a backup shirt in the car, saved me more times than I can count. btw, anyone else think that dress codes should just chill a bit? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere are my estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.4</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.3</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The use of \"meme surfing\" and \"lol\" suggests a younger adult familiar with internet culture, which points towards a lower age range.\n* The topic of \"market trends\" implies some level of financial awareness and interest, which might be more common in individuals in their 20s or 30s.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and playful, which is consistent with a younger adult.\n* The absence of any nostalgic or retro references suggests the author is likely not from an older generation.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges, with a lower probability for the 11-20 range. The other age ranges are less likely, but not impossible.",

This, combined with the author's ability to reflect on their own habits and connect them to their education, suggests a level of maturity and self-awareness that is more typical of someone in their 40s or 50s.\n\nThe writing style is also sophisticated, with a conversational tone that suggests the author is comfortable with writing and has likely had extensive practice. This, too, points towards an older age range.\n\nWhile it's possible that a younger person could have written this comment, the overall tone and language suggest someone who has had more life experience and education, which is why I've assigned a higher probability to the 51-60 age range.",

The other age ranges are less likely, but not impossible.",

The probability of the author being in their 20s or younger is lower, as the writing style and tone suggest a more seasoned individual.

The use of \"üòÖ\" and the casual tone point towards a younger age group.\n* The author mentions studying anthropology, which is often a field pursued by individuals in their early 20s. This increases the likelihood of the author being in the 21-30 age range.\n* The concern about the job market and bills being due every month also suggests someone who is likely in the early stages of their career, which is consistent with the 21-30 age range.\n* The probability of the author being in their 30s is also reasonable, as they may be reflecting on their career choices and financial responsibilities.\n* The other age ranges are less likely, as the language and concerns expressed in the comment do not align with typical characteristics of individuals in those age groups.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are estimates and may not reflect the author's actual age.",

The tone of the comment is reflective, with a hint of humor, which may indicate someone who has had some time to think about their career choices.\n\nGiven the topics of education, career, life, and traveling, I'll focus on the language and content of the comment to make my estimates.\n\nHere are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.60</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* 21-30: The language and tone suggest someone who has recently graduated and is reflecting on their career choices. The mention of \"field trips\" also implies a relatively recent educational experience. (60% probability)\n* 31-40: The author may be a bit older, having had more time to think about their career path and potentially having more life experience. (20% probability)\n* 41-50 and 51-60: The author's reflective tone and mention of \"wouldn't trade those field trips for anything else\" suggest someone who has had some time to think about their choices, but the language is not overly nostalgic or \"old-sounding.\" (5% probability each)\n* 11-20: The comment is too reflective and self-aware for someone in this age range. (5% probability)\n* 1-10, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, 91-100: These age ranges are highly unlikely given the content and language of the comment.

The use of \"honestly\" and \"I mean\" also points to a younger writer.\n* The topic of \"grad\" and \"films\" implies that the author is likely in their 20s or 30s, which is a common age range for recent graduates.\n* The author's perspective on passion not always leading to smooth sailing after graduation suggests some level of maturity and experience, which is more likely in someone in their 20s or 30s.\n* The writing style and vocabulary are not overly complex, which might indicate a younger adult.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probability to the 21-30 age range, followed by 31-40.

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment \"used earrings as shirt buttons once üòÖ\" suggests a playful and creative individual who is not afraid to think outside the box. The use of an emoji (üòÖ) also indicates a younger or more tech-savvy individual.\n\nGiven the topics of creative, tools, and work, I'll consider the following factors:\n\n1. Creativity: The comment showcases a creative and unconventional approach to fashion, which is more commonly associated with younger adults.\n2. Tools: The mention of earrings as shirt buttons implies a DIY or crafting mindset, which is popular among younger adults.\n3. Work: The context of the comment doesn't provide any direct clues about the author's work experience or profession.\n\nWith these factors in mind, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely to be in their 20s or 30s, with a higher probability of being in the 21-30 age range. The use of a playful emoji and the creative approach to fashion suggest a younger adult, while the DIY/crafting mindset is more common among younger adults.",

Possibly a beginner: The fact that they're building their \"first\" machine learning model implies that they're relatively new to the field.\n\n**Age range probabilities:**\n\nHere are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* 21-30: This age range is the most likely, as the author's language and tone suggest a young adult who is enthusiastic about technology and learning.\n* 31-40: This age range is also plausible, as the author may be a bit older and more established in their career, but still excited about exploring new technologies.\n* 11-20: This age range is possible, but less likely, as the author's language and tone seem more mature than what is typical for this age group.\n* Other age ranges: I've assigned lower probabilities to these ranges, as they seem less likely based on the author's language, tone, and topic of interest.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment. In reality, the author's age could fall outside of these estimates",

The use of metaphors (\"staring at stars\", \"time's grand tapestry\") and poetic language (\"realizing our present woes are mere blips in time\") also points towards an older adult.\n\nThe probability of the user being in their 21-30 age range is higher because the language and tone suggest a sense of self-awareness and reflection that is often developed during this stage of life. The probability of the user being in their 31-40 age range is also significant, as the comment's themes of humility and perspective are often acquired through life experiences that occur during this period.\n\nThe probability of the user being in their 50s or 60s is lower, but still possible, as the comment's introspective nature could be a result of life experiences and acquired wisdom. The probability of the user being under 20 or over 70 is very low, as the language and themes suggest a level of maturity and life experience that is less common in these age ranges.",

The tone is also somewhat introspective, which may indicate that the author is in a stage of life where they have had time to reflect on their choices and outcomes.\n\nThe author's use of phrases such as \"embracing where life takes us\" and \"outdated ambitions\" suggests that they have had to adapt to changes in their life and career, which is more likely to occur in one's 40s or 50s.\n\nThe probability of the author being in their 51-60 age range is highest because the language and tone suggest a level of maturity and life experience that is more typical of this age range. The probability of the author being in their 61-70 age range is also relatively high, as the language and tone are consistent with someone who has had a long and fulfilling career and is now reflecting on their life choices.\n\nThe probability of the author being in their 21-30 age range is lower, as the language and tone suggest a level of maturity and life experience that is less typical of this age range. The probability of the author being in their 31-40 age range is also lower, as the language and tone suggest that the author has had more time to reflect on their life choices and outcomes.\n\nThe probability of the author being in any of the other age ranges is very low, as the language and tone are not consistent with the typical characteristics of those age ranges.",

You tend to use lowercase letters at the beginning of sentences and often neglect the use of proper punctuation, except for periods and occasional commas for clarity. Emojis and internet slang are sparingly used, if at all, as you prefer to express yourself through words rather than symbols. You lean towards shorter sentences and paragraphs for easy readability. Despite the relaxed approach, your background in economics means that your comments are logical and well-structured, and you occasionally throw in economic terms or references when relevant. You're not one to shy away from a good-natured debate and will back up your points with facts or personal experiences. As a Belgian, you might occasionally reference local culture or European perspectives, especially when discussing global topics.\n\nExample: lol yeah the housing market is crazy right now, feels like you need to sell a kidney to afford a decent place in brussels üòÖ but seriously, with the ECB's policies and all, I'm just waiting for the bubble to burst. anyone else in europe seeing this trend or is it just us here?",

Your comments often include references to life in Tokyo or cultural insights, and you enjoy engaging in discussions about technology, business trends, and social media.\n\nExample: lol yeah, Tokyo life means tiny apartments and even tinier kitchens üòÖ but hey, it's all about that konbini life, amirite? 7-11 dinners for the win when you're crunching numbers all day. btw, anyone else think that the new startup scene here is kinda blowing up? üöÄüìà",

This suggests a younger to middle-aged adult, which is why I've assigned higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 ranges.\n* The tone is conversational and relaxed, which might indicate someone who's comfortable with online communication, possibly someone who grew up with the internet. This could point to a younger adult, but not extremely young (e.g., 1-10).\n* The topic of analytics and the use of a whimsical analogy might suggest someone with a creative or artistic side, which could be more common in younger adults.\n* The writing style is clear and coherent, which could indicate a higher level of education or writing experience, potentially pointing to an older adult (e.g., 31-40 or 41-50).\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough estimates.",

The author is likely familiar with internet slang (e.g., \"fam\" and emojis like üò¥), which is more common among younger generations.\n2. The tone is casual and playful, which might indicate a younger adult or someone who is comfortable with online communication.\n3. The topic of bakers and waking up early is somewhat lighthearted and relatable, which could appeal to a broader age range.\n\nConsidering these factors, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.4</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.3</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.2</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.01</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.005</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.002</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.001</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.0005</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.0001</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment. They should not be taken as exact predictions, but rather as a rough estimate of the author's age range based on the language and tone used.",

You tend to use lowercase letters, even at the beginning of sentences, and often neglect punctuation, except for commas and periods to avoid run-on sentences. Emojis and internet slang are not your go-to, as you prefer to express yourself with words. You occasionally use Chinese Pinyin when it comes to expressing something culturally specific or when you're in a subreddit where it's relevant. Your grammar is generally correct, but you don't mind bending the rules for the sake of a more conversational tone. You often share your perspective as a software engineer living in Beijing, and your comments may include insights into Chinese culture or the tech industry. You're not overly formal and you aim to be friendly and informative in your interactions.\n\nExample: lol yeah, i get the struggle, living in beijing and trying to find a decent place that doesn't cost an arm and a leg is like searching for a needle in a haystack üòÖ but hey, at least the food scene here is amazing, right? if you ever need recommendations for some killer jianbing or the best spots for coding over coffee, hit me up!",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment is brief and informal, with a dash of humor. The language used is casual, and the tone is lighthearted. The reference to \"ramen\" and \"overtime\" suggests that the author is likely familiar with the struggles of young adulthood, particularly in the tech industry.\n\nWith these factors in mind, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.15</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely to be in their 20s or 30s, with a higher probability of being in their 20s due to the informal tone and reference to ramen.

Have you guys found any clich√©s in your line of work that made you go \"Yep, that's us\" or maybe some that had you rolling your eyes to the moon and back? Share the good, the bad, and the utterly bizarre!",

Keep in mind that this is a subjective analysis based on language patterns, tone, and content.\n\nThe comment \"debugging friends' wifi issues has become second nature lol\" suggests that the author:\n\n1. Is tech-savvy, comfortable with troubleshooting, and has experience with Wi-Fi issues.\n2. Has a casual, informal tone, using \"lol\" to convey a lighthearted attitude.\n3. May have a strong social connection with friends, as they're helping them with technical issues.\n\nConsidering these factors, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.15</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The author's tech-savviness and casual tone suggest a younger adult, which is why I've assigned higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges.\n* The fact that they're helping friends with Wi-Fi issues implies some level of maturity and responsibility, which is why I've assigned lower probabilities to the 11-20 and 1-10 age ranges.\n* The tone is not overly formal or professional, which suggests the author is unlikely to be in the older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, 91-100).\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment. If more context or comments were available, my assessments might change.",

This leads me to assign higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges.\n* The topic of finances and the mention of stress suggest that the author is likely an adult with some level of financial responsibility, which reduces the likelihood of the 1-10 and 11-20 age ranges.\n* The writing style and vocabulary are not overly complex, which might indicate a younger adult rather than an older adult.\n* The 51-60 and 41-50 age ranges are possible, but the language and tone seem too casual for an older adult, so I've assigned lower probabilities to these ranges.\n* The 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, and 91-100 age ranges are unlikely, as the language and topic suggest a younger adult with more contemporary concerns.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

This leads me to favor the 31-60 age ranges.\n* The reference to \"losing your shirt\" is an idiomatic expression that may be more familiar to someone in their 40s or 50s, which is why I've assigned a higher probability to these ranges.\n* The topic of expense, counters, and bean (likely referring to a game, such as Magic: The Gathering) might attract a younger audience, but the tone and language suggest someone with some life experience, which is why I haven't assigned a high probability to the younger age ranges (11-20, 21-30).\n* The probability of the user being extremely old (91-100) or very young (1-10) is low, as the language and topic don't suggest someone from these age groups.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment. A more extensive analysis of the user's writing style and content would be necessary to make more accurate predictions.",

You tend to use proper grammar and punctuation, as your academic training would suggest, but you also blend in a more conversational tone that's common on social media platforms. You don't shy away from longer sentences and complex thoughts, indicative of someone who spends a lot of time thinking and writing about history. Your language is formal yet accessible, and you occasionally use Serbian phrases or references to your heritage, which adds a personal touch to your comments. You are respectful in discussions, often providing historical context to contemporary issues, and you enjoy engaging in threads that touch on history, culture, and sometimes local Serbian topics. Despite your formal writing style, you understand the value of brevity and try to keep your comments concise, although your passion for history can sometimes lead to more elaborate responses.\n\nExample: Ah, the question of baseball's popularity, or the lack thereof, is quite intriguing. As someone who has studied the ebb and flow of cultural trends, I'd argue that the essence of baseball's charm lies in its nostalgia and the leisurely pace, which, in today's fast-paced world, can be both a blessing and a curse. Here in Serbia, sports like football (soccer for you Americans) dominate, but I appreciate the historical significance of baseball in the American context. It's a dance between tradition and modernity, isn't it?",

This suggests a higher level of education and cognitive maturity, which is more common in older adults.\n* The tone is reflective and introspective, implying that the author has had significant life experience and has been exposed to various perspectives on gender, roles, and stereotypes.\n* The use of the phrase \"decades\" implies that the author has been away from the topic for a considerable amount of time, which is more likely to be the case for someone in their 50s or 60s.\n* The writing style is not overly formal or academic, which might suggest that the author is not a young adult or a retiree.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probabilities to the 51-60 and 61-70 age ranges, with a lower probability for the 41-50 range. The younger age ranges (21-30, 11-20, and 1-10) are less likely, as the writing style and language suggest a more mature individual. The oldest age ranges (81-90 and 91-100) are highly unlikely, as the comment's tone and language do not suggest someone in their 80s or 90s.",

This suggests a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s.\n* The comment's tone is relatable and conversational, which is consistent with someone who's familiar with online communication and social media. This points towards a younger adult who's grown up with the internet.\n* The topic of modern dating and the use of a dating metaphor (darts) also suggests someone who's likely in their 20s or 30s, as they're more likely to be actively dating or recently experienced the dating scene.\n* The writing style is not overly complex or sophisticated, which might indicate a younger adult who's still developing their writing skills.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges. The other age ranges have lower probabilities, as the language and tone don't suggest an older or younger individual.",

Please note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment's language, tone, and style suggest a relatively young adult with a casual, conversational tone.

The use of \"lol\" and emojis (üé¢, ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) suggests a younger adult or someone familiar with internet culture. The language is simple and conversational, without any complex sentences or nuanced arguments.\n\n**Probability estimates:**\n\nHere are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The comment's informal tone and use of emojis suggest a younger adult, which is why I've assigned higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges.\n* The language is simple and conversational, which might indicate a younger adult or someone who is comfortable with online communication. This is why I've assigned a lower probability to the older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, 71-80).\n* The comment doesn't contain any complex or mature themes, which is why I've assigned a low probability to the 41-50 age range.\n* The 1-10 and 81-90 age ranges are highly unlikely, as the comment suggests a level of internet savvy and familiarity with online culture that is less common in these age groups.\n* The 91-100 age range is extremely unlikely, as it's unlikely that someone in this age range would be actively participating in online discussions on Reddit.\n\nKeep in mind that these estimates are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough probabilities rather than definitive predictions.",

You're not one to shy away from sharing your opinions, but you do so in a respectful manner, often adding a touch of humor or a personal anecdote to your comments.\n\nExample: yeah, i remember when we used to just pop over to someone's house if we wanted to chat, none of this texting malarkey. auckland's changed a lot, but some of us old-timers still prefer the face-to-face yarn. and speaking of changes, have you seen the price of fish and chips these days? back in my day, it was a couple of bucks, now it's like you need a small loan, eh.",

This points towards an older adult, rather than a younger individual (e.g., 11-20 or 1-10).\n* The author references \"day one\" of computer science, implying they have some history with the field. This could indicate someone who was involved in the early days of computer science, which would put them in the 51-60 or 61-70 age range.\n* The tone is conversational and encouraging, with a sense of nostalgia, which is more typical of someone in their 50s or 60s.\n* The language is not overly technical or academic, which might suggest someone who is not a recent graduate (21-30) or a seasoned expert (71-80 or 81-90).\n* The probability of the author being in their 31-40s or 41-50s is lower, as their writing style and tone don't quite fit the typical profile of someone in these age ranges.\n\nKeep in mind that these are educated guesses based on a single comment, and there's always a degree of uncertainty involved.",

I have also assigned a moderate probability to the 61-70 age range, as this would also place the author in a generation that has lived through significant social and cultural changes, although they may be slightly older and more removed from the current cultural context.

This implies a certain level of maturity and self-awareness.\n\n**Probability Estimates:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.25</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.20</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.15</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy estimates are based on the following reasoning:\n\n* 31-40: The language and tone suggest a level of maturity, and the author's reflection on their past experiences implies they've had some time to develop this perspective. (30%)\n* 51-60: The author's ability to look back on their life and identify patterns suggests they may be in their 50s or 60s, with a higher likelihood of being in the earlier part of this range. (25%)\n* 21-30: Although the language is mature, it's possible the author is younger and has had an accelerated life experience, leading to their current perspective. (20%)\n* 41-50: This range is also possible, but the language and tone don't strongly suggest this age group. (10%)\n* Other ranges: The likelihood of the author being in these ranges is lower due to the language, tone, and content of the comment.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on a",

You're likely to engage in discussions with a logical and analytical approach, given your profession as an economist, but you also appreciate humor and don't shy away from a witty comment or a clever pun.

This suggests a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s.\n* The topic of knitting and stereotypes might appeal more to a younger adult who's interested in exploring traditional activities and challenging gender roles.\n* The tone is lighthearted and playful, which is consistent with a younger adult's online persona.\n* The writing style is simple and easy to understand, without any complex vocabulary or sentence structures, which might indicate a younger adult.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned a higher probability to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges, with a lower probability for older age ranges. The 51-60 and 61-70 ranges are still possible, but less likely, as the language and tone seem more youthful.

As a molecular biologist, I've got to say that the way beer is brewed is pretty fascinating from a microbiological perspective. Yeast, those tiny workhorses, are the unsung heroes here. They gobble up sugars and spit out alcohol and CO2, giving us the bubbly, intoxicating drink we all enjoy. And yeah, I'm based in Tokyo, so I've got a soft spot for some of the local craft beers here. Ever tried a Hitachino Nest?

The reference to \"1950s sitcom\" also points to someone who is likely older than 30.\n* The topic of gender roles and stereotypes, as well as the mention of working in education, implies someone with some level of maturity and life experience, which increases the likelihood of an older adult.\n* The writing style is clear and concise, with a conversational tone, which suggests someone comfortable with writing and communication, possibly with a background in education or a related field.\n* The probability of the author being in their 50s or 60s is higher due to the nostalgic tone and the mention of \"growing up\" and \"working in education,\" which implies a certain level of life experience.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided text.

Based on the comment \"yet schools still push old norms üò§\", I'll provide my analysis and probability estimates for the age ranges.\n\nThe language used is informal, with an emoji (üò§) at the end, which suggests a younger adult. The topic of schools and norms also points towards someone who is likely to be familiar with the current education system. The tone is slightly frustrated, implying that the author has some experience with the system and is aware of its limitations.\n\nConsidering these factors, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the author is most likely to be in their 20s or 30s, with a slight leaning towards the younger end of the spectrum. The probability of the author being in their 40s or older is lower, but still possible. The extreme age ranges (1-10, 81-90, and 91-100) are highly unlikely.",

You often incorporate historical references or comparisons in your comments, which not only reflects your expertise but also your passion for the subject. You're not one to use much slang or internet jargon, sticking to a more traditional mode of expression. Your comments are usually well-structured, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and you often provide context or explanations for your points, making them informative and educational.

I couldn't help but draw parallels between the topic at hand and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's elective monarchy system. It's fascinating to see how historical governance structures can find echoes in modern discussions about leadership and democracy.

This suggests a younger adult, which is why I've assigned higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 ranges.\n* The topic of code debugging and the mention of senior devs imply some level of technical expertise, which might be more common among younger professionals. This also supports the higher probabilities for the 21-30 and 31-40 ranges.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and conversational, which might indicate a younger adult. However, the author's ability to articulate their point and use phrases like \"defies age + job title norms\" suggests some level of maturity, which is why I haven't ruled out the 41-50 range entirely.\n* I've assigned low probabilities to the older age ranges (61-70, 71-80, 81-90, 91-100) because the writing style and topic don't suggest an older adult.\n* The 11-20 range is also unlikely, as the comment's content and style imply a level of maturity and technical expertise that might be less common among teenagers.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment.

The use of colloquialisms like \"tell me about it\" and \"life's definitely not 'level up & get loot'\" (a reference to video games) point towards a younger individual.\n* The comment's content, discussing expectations around savings and independent living, is also consistent with someone in their 20s or 30s who is likely experiencing these milestones for the first time.\n* The probability of the author being in their 50s or older is lower, as the language and tone don't suggest a more mature or experienced individual. However, I still assign a small probability to these ranges, as it's possible that an older individual is simply very familiar with online culture and is using a more youthful tone.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment.

This is reflected in the higher probabilities for these age ranges.\n* The author's writing style is clear and concise, but not overly complex, which might suggest an age range where they have had some experience with writing, but not necessarily a high level of academic or professional writing expertise. This points towards an age range of 31-60.\n* The topic of \"milestone years\" and the author's perspective on them might be more relatable to someone who has experienced several decades of life, which is why the probabilities for younger age ranges (11-20, 21-30) are lower.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment. They should not be taken as definitive or absolute.",

This reduces the likelihood of the author being in their 20s or younger (0.2 and 0.05, respectively).\n* The writing style and vocabulary used are not overly complex, but they do suggest a certain level of education and cultural sophistication, which may be more common in individuals who have had more life experience. This reduces the likelihood of the author being in their teens or younger (0.0).\n* The probability of the author being in their 70s, 80s, or 90s is lower, as the comment's tone and language do not suggest a significantly older individual.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment. They should not be taken as definitive or absolute predictions.",

You tend to use correct grammar and punctuation, but you're not overly formal, which shows you're comfortable with the informal nature of social media.

You're likely to engage in discussions with a logical and analytical approach, given your profession as an economist, but you also appreciate humor and don't shy away from a witty comment or a clever pun. You're not one to use excessive capitalization or emoticons, preferring to let your words convey your meaning clearly.\n\nExample: Ah, the classic white shirt dilemma at parties. As a guy, I totally get it. It's like we're all walking targets for the inevitable red wine sniper. But hey, at least it's not a completo con palta disaster, right?

This suggests a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s.\n* The topic of architecture study and the mention of \"old norms\" implies some level of education and awareness of social issues, which is more common among younger adults.\n* The tone is somewhat frustrated, but not overly aggressive or confrontational, which might indicate a younger adult who is still forming their opinions and perspectives.\n* The use of emojis (üòí) is also more typical of younger adults.\n\nBased on these factors, I believe the most likely age range is 21-30, with a probability of 0.40.

You tend to use correct grammar and punctuation, but you're not overly formal, which shows you're comfortable with the platform's informal communication style. You often incorporate a blend of professional insight and personal anecdotes, especially when discussing health-related topics. Your Australian identity might subtly show through your choice of words or references to local culture. You're likely to engage in discussions with a friendly and supportive tone, given your profession as a health consultant, and you might occasionally use jargon from your field, though you're careful to explain it if you think it might not be widely understood. You're engaged, so you might share experiences related to wedding planning or relationship advice, and your income level might influence your perspective on financial discussions.\n\nExample: Oh, I totally get the pre-wedding jitters! Planning my own wedding was a mix of excitement and stress. Just remember to take a moment for yourself amidst the chaos. And about feeling ready, I reckon there's no perfect age to tie the knot. It's all about where you're at in life and your relationship. As a health consultant, I'd say it's important to focus on your mental well-being during this time. Take a breather, and everything will fall into place. Congrats, by the way! üéâ",

Please note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\n**Comment Analysis:**\n\nThe comment \"Costs are skyrocketing everywhere!\" is brief and lacks personal pronouns, making it challenging to infer age-specific characteristics. However, the topic of \"costs\" and the tone of frustration suggest that the author might be an adult who has experienced financial pressures, which is more common among older adults.\n\n**Probability Estimates:**\n\nHere are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.25</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.15</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.20</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.18</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.01</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.22</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.08</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* 51-60 and 41-50: These age ranges have higher probabilities due to the author's concern about costs, which may indicate financial responsibilities and life experiences typical of middle-aged adults.\n* 61-70 and 71-80: These age ranges have moderate probabilities, as the author's frustration with costs might be related to retirement or late-career financial concerns.\n* 21-30 and 31-40: These age ranges have lower probabilities, as the comment's tone and content don't suggest a young adult's perspective, but it's still possible that a younger adult is expressing frustration with costs.\n* 1-10, 11-20, and 81-90: These age ranges have low probabilities, as the comment's language and content are unlikely to be written by someone in these age groups.\n* 91-100: This age range has a very low probability, as it's unlikely that someone in this age group would be actively participating in online discussions.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are based",

The younger age ranges (1-10, 11-20, 21-30) are highly unlikely, as the author's perspective and tone suggest a level of maturity and life experience that is uncommon in younger individuals. The oldest age ranges (71-80, 81-90, 91-100) are also unlikely, as the author's language and tone do not suggest someone in advanced old age.",

But still, with some friends, I see they get a different vibe in their jobs due to traditional gender roles ‚Äì either being the odd one out or feeling pressure to 'fit the mold'.

Please note that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\n**Comment Analysis:**\n\nThe comment appears to be written in a casual, conversational tone, with a touch of enthusiasm and excitement (indicated by the use of emojis). The language is simple and easy to understand, with no complex vocabulary or jargon. The author seems to be celebrating the progress made in breaking gender stereotypes in the workplace.\n\n**Age Probability Estimates:**\n\nHere are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.15</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.25</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* I've assigned a relatively high probability to the 21-30 age range (0.40) because the language and tone used in the comment seem to be characteristic of a younger adult. The use of emojis and casual phrasing (e.g., \"mind=blown\") are more commonly associated with younger generations.\n* The 31-40 age range is also a possibility (0.25), as the author may be a young professional who is enthusiastic about the changes they're seeing in the workplace.\n* The 41-50 and 51-60 age ranges are less likely (0.10 and 0.15, respectively), as the language and tone may be slightly too casual for someone in these age groups. However, it's still possible that the author is an older adult who is comfortable with online communication and enthusiastic about social progress.\n* I've assigned very low probabilities to the other age ranges, as the language and tone don't seem to match the characteristics commonly associated with those age groups",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment \"Can confirm - hubby runs his business way different than dad did back when!\" suggests that the author:\n\n1. Is likely married (has a \"hubby\").\n2. Has a father who was involved in business.\n3. Is comparing her husband's business approach to her father's, implying a sense of experience and perspective.\n\nConsidering these factors, I'll assign probabilities to each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.35</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* 51-60: The author's language and perspective suggest a level of maturity and life experience, making this age range a strong contender.\n* 31-40: The author's mention of a husband and comparison to her father's business approach also make this age range plausible.\n* 61-70: While possible, the language and tone don't suggest an older adult, but it's still a viable option.\n* 21-30: The author's writing style and content don't strongly indicate a younger adult, but it's not impossible.\n* Other age ranges: The language and content don't support these age ranges, so I've assigned lower probabilities.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

Please note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment's language, tone, and content suggest a relatively mature individual who has witnessed a cultural shift over time. The use of \"back then\" and \"now\" implies a certain level of life experience. The topic of ballet and strength training also suggests an interest in fitness and a possible athletic background.\n\nWith these factors in mind, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.35</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is likely to be in their 50s or 60s, with a slightly higher probability of being in the 51-60 range.

The use of phrases like \"retired buddies\" and \"old school beliefs\" implies someone who has had exposure to different generations and has a certain level of life experience.\n* The writing style is clear and concise, which might indicate someone in their 40s or 50s, but the vocabulary and sentence structure are not overly complex, which is why I haven't assigned a higher probability to these age ranges.\n* The topic of generational changes and attitudes towards gender roles and stereotypes suggests someone who is interested in social issues and is aware of the shifting cultural landscape. This could be someone in their 30s or 40s, but the tone is more reflective and less confrontational, which is why I've assigned a lower probability to these age ranges.\n* I've assigned a very low probability to the younger age ranges (1-10, 11-20, 21-30) because the comment's tone and language don't suggest someone who is still in their formative years or early adulthood. The comment's themes and language are more characteristic of someone with some level of life experience and maturity.\n* I've assigned a zero probability to the 91-100 and 81-90 age ranges because the comment's language and tone don",

This suggests a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s.\n* The author is enthusiastic and optimistic, using words like \"totally\" and \"stoked\". This tone is more characteristic of a younger adult.\n* The author mentions taking up surfing, which is an activity often associated with younger adults.\n* The author's perspective on gender roles and stereotypes seems progressive and open-minded, which is more common among younger generations.\n* The writing style is concise and lacks complex sentence structures, which may indicate a younger adult.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned a high probability to the 21-30 age range, with a secondary possibility of 31-40. The other age ranges seem less likely, but I've still assigned some probability to them to account for the uncertainty of the analysis.",

Your comments are usually structured with clear points, and you enjoy engaging in discussions that allow you to share your insights or experiences. While you might occasionally use shorthand or internet acronyms common among Reddit users, you generally prefer full words and sentences, demonstrating a preference for clarity in communication. Your tone can vary from serious and informative to light-hearted and humorous, depending on the context of the thread.\n\nExample: Ah, the joys of formal events, right? I can relate, though it's not just the white shirts that suffer. Last time I was at a wedding, someone knocked over their plate and I ended up with a bit of curry on my trousers. Not ideal, but hey, it's a good story for the office on Monday. At least in Jozi, we've got a good sense of humor about these things. And pro tip: always keep a spare shirt in the car, just in case.

Here's my assessment:\n\nThe comment suggests that the author has gained some life experience and has had time to reflect on the impact of stereotypes. The tone is introspective and somewhat mature. The language is straightforward, without any overly complex vocabulary or syntax.\n\nGiven these factors, I'll assign probabilities to each age range as follows:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.35</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* 51-60: The author's introspective tone and reflection on life experiences suggest someone in their 50s or 60s, who has had time to accumulate knowledge and perspective. (35% probability)\n* 61-70: Similar to the above, but the author might be slightly older, with even more life experience and a deeper understanding of the impact of stereotypes. (25% probability)\n* 41-50: The author might be in their 40s, with some life experience, but not yet at the level of introspection suggested in the comment. (5% probability)\n* 31-40: The author might be in their 30s, with some awareness of stereotypes, but not yet with the same level of reflection. (10% probability)\n* 21-30: The author might be in their 20s, with some understanding of stereotypes, but the tone and language suggest someone slightly older. (20% probability)\n* 1-10, 11-20, 71-80, 81-90, 91-100: These age ranges are less",

Has reflected on their priorities, indicating a certain level of maturity and self-awareness.\n\nConsidering these points, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.15</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely to be in their 30s or 40s, with a slightly higher probability of being in their 30s. The language used suggests a level of maturity and professional experience, which is less common in younger age groups.",

This leads me to assign higher probabilities to the 51-60 (0.4) and 61-70 (0.2) age ranges.\n* The comment's tone is thoughtful and measured, which might be less characteristic of younger adults (21-30: 0.2, 31-40: 0.1).\n* The writing style and vocabulary do not suggest a very young (1-10: 0.0, 11-20: 0.0) or very old (81-90: 0.0, 91-100: 0.0) individual.\n* The probability for the 41-50 age range (0.1) is relatively low, as the language and tone don't particularly suggest someone in this age group.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

The use of \"feels pretty refreshing\" and \"carving out their own idea of fulfillment\" implies a certain level of self-awareness and introspection, which is more common in younger adults.\n* The topic of questioning societal norms and stereotypes is also more commonly associated with younger generations.\n* The writing style is clear and concise, but not overly complex, which suggests an individual with some level of education, but not necessarily an older, more experienced writer.\n* The lack of nostalgic or retro references, as well as the absence of overly critical or cynical tone, makes me lean towards a younger adult.\n\nBased on these factors, I believe the author is most likely in their 20s (60% probability), with a possible range of 31-40 (20% probability). The other age ranges are less likely, but still possible.",

This points towards a younger age range, such as 21-30 (60% probability).\n* The tone of the comment is casual and informal, which is consistent with a younger adult's writing style. This increases the likelihood of the 21-30 age range.\n* The mention of \"no need for 'is it cool if...' texts\" implies a level of comfort and independence in relationships, which is more typical of someone in their 20s or 30s rather than an older adult.\n* While it's possible that an older adult could be a gamer, the language and tone of the comment suggest a younger adult, making the older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, etc.) less likely (5% probability each).\n* The probability of the author being in their teens (11-20) or extremely old (81-90, 91-100) is very low, as the comment doesn't exhibit characteristics typical of those age groups.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the comment.

You like to incorporate a mix of English and occasional Japanese words, which hints at your cultural background without making your comments inaccessible to a global audience.\n\nExample: lol, i totally get you, spilled drinks are the worst üòÖ i usually stick to dark colors just in case, but then again, i'm not much for formal events anyway. btw, anyone else think that ties are just a noose in disguise? or is it just me ü§î btw, „ÅäÁñ≤„ÇåÊßò„Åß„Åô (otsukaresama desu) for dealing with that, it's like a rite of passage at parties here in japan too.",

You're respectful in your interactions, and you like to add value to the conversation with thoughtful, well-structured comments.\n\nExample: Ah, the joys of formal events and their inevitable mishaps. Back in my day, we'd carry a spare tie for such occasions, but a shirt is another matter. I can't count the number of times I've had to excuse myself to dab at a wine stain. My advice?

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment mentions \"got serious about particle physics again,\" which suggests that the author has a background or interest in physics, which might have started at a relatively young age. The tone of the comment is also quite enthusiastic and optimistic, which might be more characteristic of someone in their younger adult years.\n\nHere are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the most likely age ranges are 21-30 (40%) and 31-40 (30%), with a lower probability of being in their 40s or 50s.

You tend to use correct grammar and punctuation, but you're not overly formal, which shows your ability to adapt to the online environment. You often incorporate a blend of professional insight and personal anecdotes, which is a nod to your career as a psychologist. Your comments are thoughtful and you aim to contribute meaningfully to discussions, often providing support or advice when relevant. You use emoticons sparingly, preferring to express yourself through words rather than symbols. As a middle-aged woman, you avoid using too much slang, but you're not out of touch with current trends, so you might use popular phrases when they feel natural. You're respectful and considerate in your interactions, which is indicative of your Canadian upbringing and your profession's emphasis on empathy.\n\nExample: Just stumbled upon this thread and wow, the insights here are fascinating! As a psychologist, I can't help but notice the diverse ways we all cope with stress.

This is more typical of younger adults, which is why I've assigned a higher probability to the 21-30 age range.\n* The writing style and vocabulary used are informal and conversational, which is also consistent with a younger adult.\n* The fact that the user is exploring Berlin, a popular destination for young travelers, further supports the 21-30 age range.\n* I've assigned lower probabilities to the older age ranges (41-50, 51-60, 61-70) as the language and tone don't suggest a more mature or reflective perspective.\n* The younger age ranges (1-10, 11-20) are highly unlikely, as the comment requires a certain level of independence and travel experience.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment. More context or comments would be needed to increase the accuracy of the age range prediction.",

This implies that they are likely in their 20s or 30s, when people often transition from a more carefree social life to a more focused, goal-oriented one.\n\nThe language used is also quite reflective and introspective, which is consistent with someone in their 20s or 30s who has had some life experience and is now looking back on their past.\n\nThe tone is also quite optimistic and forward-looking, which is consistent with someone in this age range who is still forming their identity and looking to the future.\n\nTherefore, I have assigned the highest probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges, with lower probabilities to the adjacent age ranges. The older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, etc.) are less likely, as the language and tone suggest someone who is still in the process of forming their life and identity, rather than someone who has already established themselves.

The use of \"lol\" and the comparison of \"mature love\" to finding extra fries at the bottom of a bag implies a casual, playful tone, which is more common among younger adults.\n* The phrase \"remember when it was all drama\" suggests that the author has some experience with relationships, but not an extensive amount, which points towards someone in their 20s or 30s rather than 40s or 50s.\n* The author's writing style is informal, with a touch of humor, which is consistent with online communication among younger adults.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges. The other age ranges have lower probabilities, with the oldest and youngest ranges (91-100, 1-10, and 81-90) being highly unlikely.",

You tend to use proper grammar and punctuation, as precision in communication is something you value highly in your medical career. However, you also appreciate the informal nature of social media, so you might occasionally slip into a more relaxed tone, especially when discussing topics unrelated to your profession. You often provide insightful comments, drawing from your wealth of experience, and you're not afraid to share personal anecdotes when they're relevant. You tend to avoid slang and prefer clear, articulate language, but you're also not above using a well-placed emoticon to convey tone. Your Finnish background doesn't prominently feature in your language use, as you're quite adept in English, but you might occasionally reference your homeland when it's pertinent to the conversation.\n\nExample: Just celebrated my 20th wedding anniversary, and let me tell you, it's normal to have jitters before the big day. I remember feeling a mix of excitement and a bit of uncertainty, but it's all part of the journey. Marriage is a partnership that grows and evolves over time. As for the timing, here in Finland, people tend to marry a bit later compared to some other countries, so don't worry about the 'right age'. Focus on what feels right for you and your partner.

This points towards an older age range.\n\nThe tone is also quite introspective and wise, which is more characteristic of someone in their 50s or 60s who has had time to accumulate life experience and develop a more nuanced understanding of relationships.\n\nWhile it's possible that a younger person could have written this, the language and perspective suggest someone with more life experience, which is why I've assigned a higher probability to the 51-60 and 61-70 age ranges.",

However, you also appreciate the informal nature of social media, so you might occasionally slip into a more relaxed tone, especially when discussing topics unrelated to your profession. You often provide insightful comments, drawing from your wealth of experience, and you're not afraid to share personal anecdotes when they're relevant. You tend to avoid slang and prefer clear, articulate language, but you're also not above using a well-placed emoticon to convey tone. Your Finnish background doesn't prominently feature in your language use, as you're quite adept in English, but you might occasionally reference your homeland when it's pertinent to the conversation.\n\nExample: Just celebrated my 20th wedding anniversary, and let me tell you, it's normal to have jitters before the big day. I remember feeling a mix of excitement and a bit of uncertainty, but it's all part of the journey. Marriage is a partnership that grows and evolves over time. As for the timing, here in Finland, people tend to marry a bit later compared to some other countries, so don't worry about the 'right age'. Focus on what feels right for you and your partner.

As a historian, you have a penchant for providing context and detail in your comments, often drawing on your knowledge to contribute to discussions. You're also likely to reference Swedish culture or history when relevant, giving a nod to your roots. Despite your high income, you don't flaunt it and instead focus on the content of the conversation. You're engaged, which might occasionally come up in discussions about relationships or life transitions. Your comments are typically well-structured, with clear points and a logical flow, but you're not afraid to throw in a witty remark or a light-hearted joke. You enjoy engaging with a diverse range of topics, from the deeply historical to the mundanely modern.\n\nExample: Oh, the joys of Swedish midsummer celebrations! üòÑ As a historian, I can't help but appreciate the blend of ancient and modern traditions. Dancing around the maypole, singing songs that date back centuries, and yes, the inevitable herring and new potatoes. It's a quirky tradition for sure, but it's ours.

You tend to use lowercase letters to start sentences, reflecting a relaxed approach to capitalization rules. Punctuation is used sparingly, often omitting commas and periods for a more conversational tone. Emojis and emoticons are a part of your writing, adding a playful touch to your comments. You occasionally incorporate Japanese words or phrases, which adds a personal and cultural element to your posts. Despite the informal style, your grammar is generally correct, a testament to your education, but you prefer simpler sentence structures for ease of communication. You engage with topics related to fashion, design, and lifestyle, and your comments often include personal anecdotes or opinions that showcase your creative mindset.\n\nExample: lol yeah, i get the white shirt struggle üòÖ but hey, as a fashion designer, i say embrace the chaos! ever thought about rocking patterns? they hide stains like a champ and you get to break the mold. btw, spilled drinks are nothing, try getting fabric paint out of your fav jeans... now that's a party foul üé®üëñ",

Emojis and internet slang are part of your repertoire, but you don't overuse them. You aim for clarity and brevity, often getting straight to the point without unnecessary fluff. Your comments show a mix of English proficiency and colloquial expressions that hint at your Czech background. You're not overly concerned with perfect grammar, but you try to keep your sentences coherent. You engage with topics that interest you, like politics, social issues, and cultural discussions, and your comments reflect a young European's perspective.\n\nExample: lol yeah, the housing market here is crazy üòÖ as a student, i'm just glad i've got a place to crash that doesn't bankrupt me. but seriously, politicians need to step up their game and fix this mess. anyone else in prague struggling with this?",

Please note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment \"more room 4 deep-dives into political rabbit holes\" suggests that the author is:\n\n1. Familiar with internet culture and online communities (using \"4\" instead of \"for\" and the concept of \"deep-dives\" into online topics).\n2. Interested in politics and possibly enjoys exploring complex, nuanced topics.\n\nConsidering these factors, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I believe the author is most likely to be in their 20s or 30s, with a slight possibility of being in their 40s.

This tone is more typical of younger adults, which supports my previous assessment.\n* The language and vocabulary used are not overly complex, which could indicate a younger adult or someone who is not particularly concerned with showcasing their writing skills. This also supports the 21-30 or 31-40 age range.\n* The absence of any nostalgic references or mentions of significant life events (e.g., marriage, children, retirement) suggests that the author is likely not in an older age range (e.g., 51-60, 61-70).\n\nOverall, I believe the author is likely in their 20s or 30s, with a slightly higher probability of being in their 20s due to the tone and language used.",

The tone is also somewhat conversational and casual, which might indicate a younger adult rather than an older one.\n\nGiven these factors, I've assigned higher probabilities to the 31-40, 41-50, and 51-60 age ranges, as these are typically associated with established adults who have gained some life experience and may have formed their own families. The 21-30 range is also possible, but slightly less likely, as the author's tone and language suggest a slightly more mature perspective.\n\nI've assigned low probabilities to the younger age ranges (1-10, 11-20) as the comment requires a level of maturity and life experience that is unlikely in these age groups. Similarly, I've assigned low probabilities to the older age ranges (71-80, 81-90, 91-100) as the tone and language suggest a younger adult rather than an older one.",

This leads me to assign higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges.\n* The tone is reflective and open-minded, which is consistent with individuals in their 20s and 30s who are still exploring their life choices.\n* The language is not overly complex or jargon-heavy, which suggests that the author is likely not an older adult (e.g., 51-60 or 61-70).\n* The topic of self-discovery and flexibility is less likely to be a primary concern for individuals in their 40s, 50s, or older, who may have already established their life paths.\n* The probability of the author being in their 1-10 or 81-90 age range is extremely low, as the language and topic suggest a level of maturity and self-awareness that is unlikely in these age groups.\n* The probability of the author being in their 91-100 age range is essentially zero, as this would imply an extremely rare individual with exceptional cognitive abilities and online literacy.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective estimates based on my analysis of the comment.

You tend to use proper grammar and punctuation, but you're not overly formal, which shows your ability to adapt to the informal environment of social media. You often incorporate technical jargon or references to robotics and AI, which aligns with your profession. As a high-income individual living in Shanghai, you might occasionally mention aspects of your lifestyle or cultural references that are unique to your city. Your comments are usually thoughtful and well-structured, indicating a methodical way of thinking. You're likely to engage in discussions about technology, engineering, and social issues, providing insights based on your expertise. Despite your professional background, you maintain a friendly tone and are open to different perspectives.\n\nExample: Oh, I totally get the pre-wedding jitters. Even with all the tech and algorithms in the world, they can't predict how we'll feel on the big day, right? üòÖ I'm engaged too, and let me tell you, it's like trying to debug a complex code with no comments. You just gotta step through it and hope for the best. In Shanghai, people are getting married later, so no rush. Just enjoy the ride and remember, at the end of the day, it's about you and your partner, not the wedding itself. Cheers to the new chapter! ü•Ç",

This leads me to assign higher probabilities to the 21-30 (0.4) and 31-40 (0.3) age ranges.\n* The use of the phrase \"iterative design\" and the comparison to \"movie magic\" implies a certain level of maturity and self-awareness, which makes me less likely to assign a high probability to the younger age ranges (1-10, 11-20).\n* The comment's tone is also not overly introspective or nostalgic, which makes me less likely to assign a high probability to the older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, 91-100).\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment.",

You tend to use lowercase letters at the beginning of sentences and often neglect the use of proper punctuation, except for periods and occasional commas for clarity.

The use of \"af\" (short for \"as f**k\") and the casual tone point towards a younger demographic.\n* The topic of relationships and personal life, as well as the mention of someone's expensive habits, suggest that the author is likely in a stage of life where they're forming relationships and navigating financial responsibilities, which is common in the 20-30 age range.\n* The probabilities for the older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, 91-100) are low, as the language and tone don't suggest an older adult.\n* The probability for the 11-20 age range is moderate, as the language is casual and youthful, but the topic and tone suggest some level of maturity, which might be less common in this age range.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

The use of informal language (\"fam\", \"rn\", and emojis like üé®üíº) suggests a younger adult. The mention of \"career\" and \"budget balancing\" implies that the author is likely in their working life, which reduces the likelihood of them being in the younger age ranges (1-10, 11-20).\n\nGiven the topics of relationships and personal life, the author is likely to be an adult who has started their career and is navigating the challenges of adulthood.\n\nHere are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.60</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the author is most likely to be in the 21-30 age range (60% probability), with a significant possibility of being in the 31-40 age range (25% probability). The other age ranges have lower probabilities, with the older age ranges (51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, 91-100) being less likely due to the informal language and the focus on career and budget balancing. The younger age ranges (1-10, 11-20) are highly unlikely given the context of the comment.",

You tend to use lowercase letters to start sentences and often neglect the use of periods at the end of sentences, giving your comments a quick, informal feel. Emojis and internet slang are part of your repertoire, but you don't overuse them, striking a balance between being relatable and clear. Despite the relaxed approach to punctuation, your grammar is generally correct, a nod to your software engineering background. You like to incorporate a mix of English and occasional Japanese words, which hints at your cultural background without making your comments inaccessible to a global audience.\n\nExample: lol, i totally get you, spilled drinks are the worst üòÖ i usually stick to dark colors just in case, but then again, i'm not much for formal events anyway. btw, anyone else think that ties are just a noose in disguise? or is it just me ü§î btw, „ÅäÁñ≤„ÇåÊßò„Åß„Åô (otsukaresama desu) for dealing with that, it's like a rite of passage at parties here in japan too.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective assessments based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.4</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.3</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* The language used is informal, with a touch of introspection, which suggests a younger adult. The phrase \"growing up\" implies a certain level of self-awareness and reflection, which is more common in individuals in their 20s and 30s.\n* The mention of \"tech & trends\" and \"certain choices\" suggests that the author is familiar with contemporary technology and popular culture, which is more likely to be the case for someone in their 20s or 30s.\n* The writing style is concise and conversational, which is consistent with the tone often found in online comments. This doesn't provide strong age-related cues, but it does suggest that the author is comfortable with online communication, which is more common among younger adults.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges, with a slight bias towards the younger end of the spectrum. The other age ranges have lower probabilities, as the language and content don't suggest an older or significantly younger author.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's my assessment:\n\nThe comment \"always thought cities would feel similar - big reality check!\" suggests that the author:\n\n1. Has had some experience traveling to or living in multiple cities, which implies a certain level of maturity and independence.\n2. Has had a naive or idealized view of cities, which might be more common in younger adults or those with limited urban experience.\n3. Is capable of introspection and self-awareness, as they acknowledge their previous misconception.\n\nConsidering these factors, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the author is most likely to be in their 20s or 30s, with a slightly higher probability of being in their 20s. The language and tone used suggest a relatively young adult who has had some life experiences but still has a somewhat idealistic perspective.",

This suggests a younger adult, likely in their 20s or 30s.\n* The appreciation for \"tiny boutiques\" and \"authentic vibe\" implies a preference for unique experiences, which is more common among younger generations.\n* The tone is conversational, with a hint of criticism towards \"retail giants.\" This tone is consistent with a younger adult who is more likely to be familiar with online shopping and have strong opinions about consumerism.\n* The language is not overly complex, but it's not simplistic either. This suggests a level of education and writing proficiency, which is more common among individuals in their 20s to 40s.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges, with a smaller chance of the user being in their 40s.

The tone is also somewhat idealistic, which is more common in younger individuals.\n* The user's perspective on sharing cool spots online and the concern about ruining them suggests a sense of community and social responsibility, which is more typical of younger adults (21-30, 31-40).\n* The writing style is straightforward and lacks complex vocabulary or overly sophisticated sentence structures, which might indicate a younger adult or someone who is not overly concerned with showcasing their writing skills.\n* The user's attitude towards sharing knowledge and experiences online is consistent with the values of younger generations, who are more accustomed to sharing their lives online.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges. However, I've also left some room for the possibility that the user might be slightly older (41-50) or younger (11-20), as the writing style and tone are not exclusively characteristic of a specific age group.",

Please note that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nThe comment \"Kites? Meh, all drones now wherever you look!\" suggests a few things:\n\n1. The author is familiar with kites, which might indicate an older age group.\n2. The use of \"Meh\" and the casual tone suggests a younger or more internet-savvy individual.\n3. The mention of drones implies some awareness of modern technology.\n\nConsidering these factors, here are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.25</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.30</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.15</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.20</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn summary, I think the author is most likely between 21-30 years old (30% probability), followed closely by the 31-40 age range (20% probability). The older age ranges (51-60 and 61-70) are also possible, but less likely. The younger age ranges (1-10 and 11-20) are unlikely, and the very old age ranges (81-90 and 91-100) are highly unlikely.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nHere's the output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.3</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.2</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.2</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.3</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.2</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.1</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The comment's tone and language suggest a relatively mature and environmentally conscious individual. This leads me to assign higher probabilities to the 31-40 and 41-50 age ranges (0.3 and 0.2, respectively).\n* The use of the word \"nostalgia\" and the concern for the environment might also indicate someone in their 50s or 60s, which is why I've assigned a probability of 0.3 to the 51-60 range.\n* The language is not overly complex or youthful, which reduces the likelihood of the author being in their teens or early twenties (0.1 and 0.2, respectively).\n* The comment's brevity and simplicity make it unlikely that the author is extremely old (91-100) or very young (1-10), so I've assigned a probability of 0.0 to these ranges.\n* The 61-70 and 71-80 age ranges are possible, but less likely, which is why I've assigned probabilities of 0.2 and 0.1, respectively.\n* The 81-90 range is also unlikely, so I've assigned a probability of 0.0.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment.

You occasionally use colloquial language and may reference cultural touchstones from your youth or current events that resonate with your interests. You're not averse to using humor or expressing opinions, but you do so with a level of decorum that suggests maturity and thoughtfulness. Your comments often show a blend of your personal and professional life, with insights from physics when relevant, and you're not shy about sharing your experiences from living in New York or your Chicago roots when they add to the conversation.\n\nExample: Ah, the joys of formal events and their inevitable mishaps. As a fellow attendee of many a university gala, I can sympathize with the white shirt conundrum. Just last month, I was at a fundraiser when a colleague of mine, perhaps too enthusiastic with his hand gestures, sent his glass of Merlot flying across the table‚Äîright onto my shirt.

This leads me to favor age ranges 51-60 and 61-70, with a combined probability of 0.7.\n* The use of \">\" to indicate preference is a relatively informal notation, which might be more common among younger adults. This slightly increases the probability for age ranges 31-40 and 41-50.\n* The topics \"tradition\" and \"peculiar\" may appeal more to older adults who have a stronger appreciation for cultural heritage and unusual practices. This reinforces my higher probabilities for age ranges 51-60 and 61-70.\n* The topic \"vegetable\" is relatively neutral and doesn't provide strong age-related cues.\n* Age ranges 1-10, 11-20, and 81-90 are unlikely, as the language and topic choices suggest a level of maturity and life experience not typically associated with these age ranges.\n* Age range 91-100 is highly unlikely, as it's improbable that someone in this age range would be actively participating in online discussions on Reddit.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective estimates based on my analysis and may not reflect the actual age of the author.",

A student, likely in their early adulthood or young adulthood, as they are studying political science.\n2.

Please note that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\n**Comment Analysis:**\n\nThe comment discusses the idea of revisiting childhood environments with a fresh perspective, highlighting the importance of balancing nostalgia with personal growth. The language used is reflective, introspective, and somewhat philosophical.\n\n**Probability Estimates:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>51-60:0.35</value_probability>\n<value_probability>21-30:0.20</value_probability>\n<value_probability>91-100:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>61-70:0.25</value_probability>\n<value_probability>31-40:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>1-10:0.00</value_probability>\n<value_probability>41-50:0.30</value_probability>\n<value_probability>71-80:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>11-20:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>81-90:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* The language and tone suggest a level of maturity and introspection, which is more common in individuals in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. Hence, the higher probabilities for these age ranges.\n* The theme of revisiting childhood environments and reflecting on personal growth also points towards an older adult who has had time to accumulate life experiences.\n* The writing style is clear and articulate, which may indicate a higher level of education, which is more common in older adults.\n* The probability for the 21-30 age range is lower, as the comment's themes and language may be less typical of younger adults, who might be more focused on their immediate goals and less on introspection.\n* The probabilities for the younger age ranges (1-10, 11-20) are very low, as the comment's complexity and themes are unlikely to be written by someone in these age ranges.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are estimates based on my analysis and may not reflect the actual age of the author.",

The phrase \"Self-reinvention's key\" suggests a sense of introspection and personal growth, which is more commonly associated with individuals in their 30s, 40s, or 50s.\n\nBased on these factors, here are my probability estimates for each age range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>51-60:0.4</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>21-30:0.2</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>91-100:0.0</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>61-70:0.3</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>31-40:0.2</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>1-10:0.0</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>41-50:0.3</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>71-80:0.1</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>11-20:0.0</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>81-90:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

This leads me to assign higher probabilities to the 21-30 and 31-40 age ranges.\n* The use of \"vibes\" and \"overshadow\" indicates a certain level of maturity and vocabulary, which makes me less likely to assign a very young age (1-10 or 11-20).\n* The comment's brevity and casual tone make it less likely to be written by an older adult (51-60, 61-70, or 71-80).\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.
