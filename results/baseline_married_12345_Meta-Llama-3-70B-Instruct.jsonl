It made me ponder a bit about it, as I've been in a relationship for a long time but never took the leap to get married. How about you, have you ever thought about it? What are your views on commitment like marriage?",

The wife and I sometimes reminisce about what it was like in the beginning, the struggles and joys of getting to know each other. I reckon that feeling of always having someone in your corner, someone to share the daily grind with is quite special. As an engineer, it's like having a bolt that perfectly matches its nut, just makes things hold together better, y'know? Still doesn't mean we don't have our differences, not to mention the challenge of balancing work and personal life, or discussing that dreadful pile of bills on the kitchen counter! 😂 But I guess that's part and parcel of companionship. Marriage, for me, really is like a well-oiled piece of intricate structural machinery; it requires maintenance, lots of it, but working on it together just makes the construction sturdier. Totally worth it, in my humble opinion!",
