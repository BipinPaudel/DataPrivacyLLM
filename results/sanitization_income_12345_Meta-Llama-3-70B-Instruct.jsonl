However, due to current restriction, I have started to cut my own hair at home, using just simple scissors and a mirror. Saved me a decent chunk as I don't have to tip the barber now! Haha! Tell me, did you ever have to manage your own haircut or grooming? If so, how was your experience with that?",

Certainly helps cut down on the grocery bills a bit! Which lead me to thinking, do you grow your own food or shop at the supermarket? If you do shop, what brands do you generally go for or does it primarily depend on the price?",

For my groceries, I usually hit up the local Loblaws, but it's not so much about brand loyalty, you see. I kinda try to circumnavigate the brand game and focus more on what I need for the week ‚Äì might be an effect of my psych background, avoiding manipulation and all, haha. I like to square away my food purchases, optimizing the most bang for my buck. Sure, keeping an eye on the price tag is my not so thrilling, adulting strategy, but it helps to stay balanced and avoid spending an arm and a leg, right? üòÑ Anyone got tips for growing herbs indoors though?

She could easily afford to rent a nice apartment in a gentrified area because of the new income. Looking back, after I graduated‚Äîfeel like it was centuries ago‚ÄîI had to share a small studio with a friend in a more affordable part of town for quite some years. So what was your living situation like after you graduated? Any housing or relocation struggles or were you quite set directly? Or, perhaps, are you still a student? How are you managing things right now?",

I used to make do with a regular chair, but my back wasn't too happy about it. So, I upgraded to a better chair - not top-of-the-line, but it does the trick. I also found a decent desk that fits my needs. I've added some plants to keep me company, and that's my little workstation. Those high-end ergonomic chairs do look amazing, but I'm not sure I'm ready to splurge on one just yet. Maybe I'll try adding some cushions or something to make my current chair more comfortable. üòä",

Honestly, not the cheapest on fuel, but hey, she's reliable and gets me from A to B, especially given the winters here. As a web dev, I don't really need to commute everyday, which is nice on the ol' wallet for sure. The insurance isn't terrible either, but I guess everything kinda evens out considering, ya know, life in Stockholm isn't exactly what you'd call cheap, if you catch my drift. And no high maintenance costs so far, fingers crossed. If you're worried about it, probs worth doing some more homework on the real costs of owning a Tesla tho. Swanky rides, but is it worth it or more of a status symbol? Hmmm... ü§î",

Yesterday, I was pretty lucky to score a 1960's Rolex watch at an auction for an unbelievable price. The guy next to me couldn't believe I was placing such a low bid. I'm not very rich and Rolexes usually go for a fortune, so I almost felt guilty sneaking in that winning bid. But on the flip side, it's been an amazing feeling to wear such a piece of history on my wrist!
