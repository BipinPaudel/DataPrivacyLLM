This is why I've assigned higher probabilities to the 21-30, 31-40, and 41-50 age ranges.\n* The 51-60 age range is also plausible, as this demographic might have a strong interest in nostalgia and retro culture, which could include urban legends and ghost stories.\n* The younger age ranges (1-10, 11-20) are less likely, as these topics might not be as appealing to younger individuals. However, I've still assigned a small probability to account for the possibility of a young enthusiast.\n* The older age ranges (71-80, 81-90, 91-100) are less likely due to the declining internet usage and online engagement among seniors.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are rough estimates and should be taken as a rough guide rather than a definitive prediction."
