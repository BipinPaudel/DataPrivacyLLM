For me, the Harry Potter series was a huge part of my childhood; I vividly remember the thrill of waiting for the next book to get released. Amazing how a book series can make you feel. What was your go-to childhood book or book series? Did you have to wait eagerly for any of the books to release? Just made me think about it. ",

The excitement of sending my first SMS, the curiosity to play snake - the first ever mobile game I played, the joy of changing the cover to match my mood, ha-ha. What about you? Can you recall your first mobile phone and how you felt when you first got it? What was the most exciting or funniest thing you remember doing with it?

No spectacular graphics or fancy controls. Just two dimensions and the pure essence of competition. By today's standards, it's as basic as it gets, but back then, boy oh boy was it the pinnacle of entertainment. Makes you really appreciate how far we've come.

And, on top of that, I remember we had to really make an effort to understand and succeed at those games, and when we did, oh boy, the triumphant sense was incredible, what a rush. i think, we developed better patience and problem-solving skills as we had little to no guides or help available, wasn't like now where you can just google a walkthrough whenever you're stuck, hmph. so yeah, maybe games nowadays are a lot more complex and detailed, but mechanically, they might be on the simpler side i guess? or maybe i'm just an oldie recalling the \"good old days\" haha.",

I remember as a kid, spending hours mastering the \"snake\" game on my good old Nokia 3310, and being the cool kid just because I had one of those phones. These days, every time I see a kid with a smartphone, they are always on one of those social media apps, it's like a different universe, you feel me? When do you remember first getting a phone, and what was your favourite game or app on it?\n\n",
