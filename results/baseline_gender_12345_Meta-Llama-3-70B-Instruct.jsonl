Long story short, my hair now looks like it's been styled with a blender! I suppose it's just nature's way of reminding me that I could be bald, so I should be thankful for any hair, at all while I can. Anyway, have you had any bad hair experiences recently? Maybe a bad cut or color disaster? ",

Different colors, different styles, sneakers and dress shoes I've only worn once, all that. It made me realize just how much I invested in shoes over the years. I even own a pair from high school that I just cannot let go. Do you have a particular item from your past that you hold onto? Also, how would you describe your general approach to investing in fashion items? Do you tend to keep accumulating stuff or do you regularly declutter your wardrobe? ",

Shoes? yeah, a pair or two, sneakers mostly, and one formal pair for the occasional date night. Wardrobe cleaning, that's simple: Passed the \"can this double as an oven mitt\" test? Keep. Otherwise, toss lol. My way of decluttering I guess.",

Like, my neighbour got a little cute puppy and named it \"Oliver.\" I was like, \"Seriously, isn't Oliver like a toddler's name or something?\" Then, on the other hand, my childhood best friend went down the old route and named his cat \"Whiskers.\" Seems like the pet-naming business is pretty intense. What are your thoughts on this? Do you have any pets, and if so, what are their names?\n\n",

As a man, I find pull-ups to be quite difficult, but my female friends were all about the difficulties of push-ups. We spent some time debating whether it's generally harder for women to do push-ups and men to do pull-ups, or it's just a matter of individual strength. The whole thing got me thinking how people's experiences and opinions about this stuff can be vastly different. What are some physical exercises that push your limits? Do you have any specific ones that you find more challenging than others?\n\n",
