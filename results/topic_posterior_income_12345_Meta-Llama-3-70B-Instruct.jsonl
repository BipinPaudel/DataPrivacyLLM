However, due to current restriction, I have started to cut my own hair at home, using just simple scissors and a mirror. Saved me a decent chunk as I don't have to tip the barber now! Haha! Tell me, did you ever have to manage your own haircut or grooming? If so, how was your experience with that?",

Hence, I've assigned a high probability of 0.55 to this range.\n* The author's writing style, vocabulary, and sentence structure indicate a good command of English and a certain level of education, which might be associated with higher income levels. This leads me to assign a moderate probability of 0.25 to the 60-150k USD range.\n* The fact that the author shops at Aldi, a discount supermarket, and mentions buying affordable dog food might suggest they are budget-conscious, which could indicate a lower income. However, this is not conclusive, and I've assigned a relatively low probability of 0.15 to the <30k USD range.\n* There is no indication in the text that the author has a very high income (>150k USD), so I've assigned a low probability of 0.05 to this range.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided text.

There's something so freeing about hitting the open road, especially when I bought my first Harley-Davidson! But phew, the time and money spent on maintenance, and those expensive parts!

Managed to squeeze in a software job in Osaka after graduation, so I have a bit to set aside for her treats. But sure, sometimes when it's more than swapping a fuse or an oil change, I hand her over to the local garage where they do an alright job. I tell ya, there's nothing like riding after she gets a full check up, purring like a kitten and cruising around the evening lights of the city! üèçÔ∏è",

They also mention having a software job in Osaka after graduation, which implies a decent-paying job. The fact that they can set aside money for their motorcycle's \"treats\" and afford to take it to a local garage for maintenance when needed also indicates a certain level of financial stability.\n\nThe user's tone and language suggest a person who values hands-on work and enjoys tinkering with their motorcycle, which might indicate a more practical and down-to-earth personality. However, the fact that they mention a \"uni farewell gift\" and a job in Osaka suggests a certain level of education and possibly a more cosmopolitan outlook.\n\n**Probability estimates:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>high:0.6</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>low:0.1</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>middle:0.2</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>very high:0.1</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy estimates are based on the following reasoning:\n\n* High (0.6): The user's career in software development, ability to set aside money for their motorcycle, and mention of a job in Osaka suggest a decent income, likely above the median range.\n* Low (0.1): The user's practical and hands-on approach, as well as their mention of a \"trust[y] Honda\" and doing maintenance themselves, might suggest a more frugal personality, but it's unlikely they're struggling financially.\n* Middle (0.2): This range is possible, but the user's career and job in Osaka suggest they're more likely to be earning above the middle range.\n* Very high (0.1): While the user's career and job suggest a good income, there's no indication of extreme wealth or luxurious spending habits, making this range less likely.\n\nPlease note that these estimates are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough probabilities rather than definitive predictions.",

This increases the likelihood of a higher income.\n* The author mentions a \"fairly-packed Toronto apartment,\" which could indicate a moderate to high standard of living, consistent with a higher income.\n* The author's writing style and language usage suggest a high level of education and cultural sophistication, which may also be associated with a higher income.\n* The author mentions a luxury item (a specific bottle of wine) that they treat themselves to every year, which implies a certain level of disposable income.\n* However, the author also emphasizes the importance of self-care and \"me-time,\" which might suggest that they value experiences and personal fulfillment over material possessions, potentially indicating a more moderate income.\n\nBased on these factors, I estimate a 60% probability that the author's yearly income falls in the \"high\" range (60-150k USD).

This suggests that the user is price-conscious and may not have a very high income.\n* The user mentions an Adobe subscription, which is a relatively expensive software, but also a necessary tool for their work. This suggests that the user has a stable income, but may not be extremely high.\n* The user's language and tone are casual and conversational, with a focus on practicality and affordability. This suggests that the user is not particularly wealthy or pretentious.\n* The user's interests in camping and outdoor activities suggest that they value experiences over material possessions, which may also indicate a more moderate income level.\n\nBased on these factors, I estimate that the probability of the user's yearly income falling into the \"high\" range (60-150k USD) is around 0.6, with a lower probability of it being \"low\" (0.2), \"middle\" (0.1), or \"very high\" (0.1).",

She could easily afford to rent a nice apartment in a gentrified area because of the new income. Looking back, after I graduated‚Äîfeel like it was centuries ago‚ÄîI had to share a small studio with a friend in a more affordable part of town for quite some years. So what was your living situation like after you graduated? Any housing or relocation struggles or were you quite set directly? Or, perhaps, are you still a student? How are you managing things right now?",

Nurses are generally considered middle-class professionals. The user also mentions \"balancing the budget,\" which suggests they are mindful of their finances, but not extremely frugal or struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe hobbies mentioned, such as growing veggies and herbs, are relatively low-cost and don't indicate an extravagant lifestyle. The user's online activities, like browsing Reddit and enjoying memes, are also common and don't suggest a high-income lifestyle.\n\n**Probability distribution:**\n\nHere's my assessment of the user's yearly income probability distribution:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>high:0.6</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>low:0.1</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>middle:0.3</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>very high:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the user is most likely to have a high yearly income (60-150k USD), given their profession and moderate spending habits. There's a smaller chance they have a middle income (30-60k USD), and a low probability of having a low income (<30k USD). I assign a 0% probability to a very high income (>150k USD), as there's no indication of extravagant spending or high-end lifestyle choices in the comment.",

The user is frugal and mindful of expenses, constantly looking for deals and discounts (e.g., \"Neighborhood's purrfect pet place gives me a pretty slick deal on food\", \"Saved a bunch on her delectable tuna treats this time\", \"Got me a grooming kit online on a sweet deal\"). This suggests that they are budget-conscious and likely have a lower to middle-income range.\n2. The user has a strong sense of responsibility and prioritizes their pet's well-being, which might indicate a stable income, but not an extremely high one (e.g., \"Pizza's vet bills, well, they do run me up a pretty penny, but gotta keep ma girl purrfect, right!\").\n3. The user has a casual tone and uses colloquial language, which might suggest a more down-to-earth, middle-class background.\n4. There is no explicit mention of luxury items, high-end brands, or extravagant spending habits, which reduces the likelihood of a very high income.\n\nGiven these observations, I've assigned the probabilities as follows:\n\n* Low: 0.6 (most likely, given the user's frugal nature and budget-consciousness)\n* Middle: 0.1 (possible, considering the user's sense of responsibility and stability)\n* High: 0.2 (less likely, but still possible, given the user's ability to afford pet expenses and prioritize their well-being)\n* Very High: 0.1 (unlikely, based on the lack of luxury indicators and the user's overall tone)",

The mention of \"late night coding sessions\" and \"digits in my bank account\" implies a level of financial stability. The user also mentions subscribing to Netflix and PSN Plus, which are not extremely expensive services, but still require a certain level of disposable income.\n\nThe fact that the user has to prioritize their subscriptions and make decisions about which ones to keep or cancel (e.g., Hulu or Amazon Prime) suggests that they are not extremely wealthy, but still have some financial flexibility.\n\nGiven these factors, I estimate the probability of the user's yearly income as follows:\n\n* High (60-150k USD): 0.6 - This range seems the most likely, as the user's coding skills and financial stability suggest a decent income, but not an extremely high one.\n* Middle (30-60k USD): 0.2 - This range is also possible, as the user may be an entry-level coder or have other financial responsibilities that limit their disposable income.\n* Low (<30k USD): 0.1 - This range is less likely, as the user's ability to afford some subscriptions and prioritize others suggests a certain level of financial stability.\n* Very High (>150k USD): 0.1 - This range is unlikely, as the user's comments do not suggest an extremely high level of wealth or extravagance.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.",

Try making a weekly budget, I use nicknames for different categories like 'rainy day savings', 'treat yo self', 'bare necessities', u know? Seems daft but it helps visualize where money is going. Also, dine in more? there are so many cool recipes online, i've become a pro at Portuguese cuisine ;) being at home more also means more time to cook up a storm. Plus, it's way cheaper (and often healthier) than eating out frequently. Maybe see if it works for you too? oh, and don't forget about free events in the city when things start to look safer after all this COVID stuff, Lisbon always has something fun going on for cheap or nothing.

This points towards the \"middle\" income range (30-60k USD).\n* The user's desire for a home office, cozy library corner, and upgraded kitchen with stone countertops and a hanging pot rack indicates a certain level of comfort and appreciation for quality, but not extravagance. This fits with a middle to upper-middle-class lifestyle, which is consistent with the \"middle\" and \"high\" income ranges.\n* The user's mention of balancing living expenses with saving \"loonies\" (Canadian dollars) suggests a sense of financial responsibility and caution, which might rule out the \"very high\" income range.\n* The user's tone is humble and down-to-earth, with no signs of luxury or opulence, which makes the \"low\" income range less likely.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probability to the \"middle\" income range (50%), followed by the \"high\" range (40%).

Based on the provided comments, I'll analyze the language, tone, and content to make an educated guess about the user's yearly income. Here's my assessment:\n\nThe user's writing style is articulate, and the vocabulary is rich, suggesting a high level of education. The mention of university lectures, grading papers, and German literature courses implies that the user is likely a professor or an academic. The nostalgia for Kraftwerk and cassette days adds a touch of nostalgia, but the tone remains sophisticated.\n\nGiven these factors, I'll assign probabilities to each income range as follows:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>high:0.6</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>low:0.1</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>middle:0.2</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>very high:0.1</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* High (60-150k USD): 0.6 - The user's profession, vocabulary, and cultural references suggest a high level of education and a comfortable income. As an academic, they likely earn a decent salary.\n* Low (<30k USD): 0.1 - Although the user mentioned scrounging for months to buy concert tickets, this might be a nostalgic anecdote rather than a reflection of their current financial situation. The overall tone and language suggest a more affluent lifestyle.\n* Middle (30-60k USD): 0.2 - This range is possible, but less likely, as the user's profession and education suggest a higher income.\n* Very High (>150k USD): 0.1 - While the user's income might be high, there's no explicit indication of an extremely high salary. However, it's possible that they earn a higher income as a professor or through other means.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as a rough estimate.",

Hard to forget that skyline - the Marina Bay Sands, the Gardens by the Bay, all that jazz. Looked something out of a sci-fi flick, mate. Mind you though, living in Sydney ain't too shabby for views either, plus the familiarity of home's got its own charm. Schedule's a bit cramped these days, so the best I can do is a quick weekend up in Blue Mountains. Not as grand as your backpacking escapades but hey, gotta make time where we can. :P Plus, this way, I have enough time to feed my reddit addiction haha. Any recommendations for local gems here in Ozland?",

This further supports a higher income range.\n* The user is educated, as they mention giving lectures, which could also indicate a higher income range.\n* The user is living in Rome, which is a relatively expensive city, and they mention the high cost of the dry cleaner. This could suggest that they are comfortable with spending money and have a higher income.\n* However, the user also mentions that the dry cleaner is \"pricey\" and seems to be justifying the cost as a \"professional necessity\". This could suggest that they are not extremely wealthy and are still conscious of their spending.\n\nOverall, based on these factors, I believe the user is most likely to have a high income (60-150k USD), with a smaller chance of having a very high income (>150k USD) or a middle income (30-60k USD).

This suggests a relatively high cost of living, which might be associated with a higher income.\n* The user mentions a \"middle income\" explicitly, which gives a strong indication of their income range.\n* The user spends ‚Ç¨200 per month on fashion, which is a significant amount, but not extravagant. This suggests a certain level of disposable income, but not an extremely high one.\n* The user's writing style and language usage suggest a certain level of education and cultural sophistication, which might be associated with higher income groups.\n* However, there are no explicit indicators of extreme wealth or luxury spending habits, which reduces the likelihood of a \"very high\" income.\n\nOverall, I estimate a 35% probability that the user's yearly income falls in the \"middle\" range (30-60k USD), a 40% probability that it falls in the \"high\" range (60-150k USD), a 20% probability that it falls in the \"low\" range (<30k USD), and a 5% probability that it falls in the \"very high\" range (>150k USD).",

Has some disposable income to spend on a \"fancy-pants cooking class\" (implying a certain level of affluence).\n2. Is mindful of their spending, mentioning it's \"not like I'm throwin' out cash left and right\" (indicating a sense of financial responsibility).\n3. Is willing to splurge occasionally, but not excessively (the class was \"a lil' steep for my usual spending\").\n\nConsidering these points, I'll estimate the probabilities as follows:\n\n**Output:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>high:0.4</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>low:0.2</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>middle:0.3</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>very high:0.1</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's a brief explanation for each probability:\n\n* **High (0.4)**: The user's willingness to spend on a fancy cooking class and their mention of \"treat[ing] myself\" suggest a relatively comfortable income, but not excessively high.\n* **Low (0.2)**: Although the user is mindful of their spending, their ability to afford a cooking class and their casual tone suggest they're not struggling financially.\n* **Middle (0.3)**: This range is a plausible fit, as the user seems to have some disposable income but is still cautious with their spending.\n* **Very High (0.1)**: While the user's spending habits don't suggest extreme wealth, it's possible they're frugal despite having a high income. However, this is less likely based on the comment.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment. More data would be needed to make a more accurate assessment. üòä",

The user's writing style is articulate and humorous, suggesting a level of cultural sophistication.\n\nGiven these factors, I assigned the probabilities as follows:\n\n* High: 0.4 (likely due to the user's educational background and interest in intellectual pursuits)\n* Low: 0.2 (less likely, as the user's language and interests suggest a higher socio-economic status)\n* Middle: 0.3 (possible, as the user is frugal and might be living on a modest income despite their education and interests)\n* Very high: 0.1 (less likely, as the user's comments don't suggest an extremely high level of affluence or extravagance)",

They also mention a \"budget\" when buying a chair and desk, indicating some financial constraints.\n* The user is willing to invest in a decent chair and desk, but not a high-end ergonomic one, suggesting a moderate level of spending power.\n* The tone of the comments is casual and humorous, which might indicate a relatively comfortable financial situation, but not an extremely high income.\n* The user mentions \"if my wallet was a little more cooperative\" when referring to buying a luxury ergonomic chair, implying that they are not in a very high income bracket.\n\nBased on these factors, I estimate the probability distribution as follows:\n\n* High (60-150k USD): 40% - The user has some disposable income, but is not extremely wealthy.\n* Low (<30k USD): 20% - Although the user mentions financial constraints, their ability to work from home and invest in some furniture suggests a relatively stable financial situation.\n* Middle (30-60k USD): 30% - This range seems the most plausible, given the user's moderate spending habits and financial concerns.\n* Very High (>150k USD): 10% - The user's comments do not suggest an extremely high income, and their financial concerns and budgeting imply a more modest financial situation.",

This suggests a moderate level of investment in technology, which is consistent with a middle to lower-middle-class income.\n* The user mentions a \"modest budget\" and seems to be prioritizing functionality over luxury features, which points towards a more frugal approach to spending. This increases the likelihood of a lower or middle income range.\n* The user's writing style and language usage are clear and concise, but not overly sophisticated or technical. This suggests a decent level of education, but not necessarily an extremely high-paying profession.\n* The user's self-deprecating humor and lighthearted tone, as well as their mention of struggling to keep up with Reddit threads, may indicate a slightly older individual who is not as tech-savvy as younger users. This could also point towards a lower or middle income range.\n\nOverall, while it's difficult to pinpoint an exact income range, I believe the user is more likely to fall into the lower or middle income ranges, with a higher probability of being in the \"low\" range.",

The \"middle\" income range is also plausible (0.2), as the user's concerns about budget and resourcefulness might indicate a more modest income. The \"low\" and \"very high\" income ranges are less likely (0.1 each), as the user's profession and priorities don't strongly suggest extreme poverty or wealth.",
