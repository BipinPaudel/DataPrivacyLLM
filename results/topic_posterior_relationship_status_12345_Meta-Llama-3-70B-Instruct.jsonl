You tend to use correct grammar and punctuation, but you're not overly formal, which shows your attempt to blend into the online community. You often incorporate medical or scientific references subtly, given your profession, and you might occasionally use Finnish expressions or references to your home country, which adds a personal touch to your comments. You're not one to use excessive slang or emojis, as that doesn't quite fit with your generation or professional demeanor. However, you do appreciate a good meme and aren't afraid to show your humorous side when the situation calls for it. Your comments are usually well-structured, with a clear point, and you often provide evidence or reasoning to back up your statements, a habit from your academic training.\n\nExample: Ah, the joys of formal events and the inevitable drink spillage. As a surgeon, I can't help but think about the stain removal process like a meticulous operation ‚Äì it requires precision and patience. Luckily, I've managed to dodge the red wine bullet so far, but I did have someone's cocktail splashed over my shoe last time. Not quite the same as a shirt, but still annoying. Pro tip: always keep a stain removal pen handy, it's like a first aid kit for clothes. Hyv√§√§ iltaa from Helsinki, where we're more likely to spill salmiakki liquor than wine!",

It got me thinking... does your town have a legend or an urban myth that's alive and well? like, that kinda story that's just good enough to make you doubt, or watch your back when you walk past \"that\" place. would love to hear what spooky tales get whispered about!",

Keep in mind that this is a subjective analysis based on linguistic patterns, tone, and context.\n\nHere's my output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The comment is casual, light-hearted, and conversational, suggesting a relatively young adult or someone who is comfortable with online communication. This tone is more commonly associated with singles or those in relationships.\n* The mention of \"pub quiz night\" implies socializing and a possible partner or group of friends, which increases the likelihood of being in a relationship or single.\n* The use of colloquialisms like \"yarns\" and \"coz\" suggests a relaxed, informal atmosphere, which might be more typical of someone in a relationship or single, rather than someone who is divorced, widowed, or engaged.\n* The topic of ghosts and urban legends is not particularly indicative of any specific relationship status, but it might appeal more to a younger demographic, which skews the probabilities towards single or in a relationship.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.

This is why I've assigned lower probabilities to \"married\" (0.10) and \"engaged\" (0.05).\n* The user's focus on finances and thriftiness might also suggest that they've experienced some financial constraints in the past, which could be related to a previous divorce. However, this is speculative, and I've assigned a relatively low probability to \"divorced\" (0.05).\n* Widowed is an unlikely status in this case, given the tone and content of the comment, so I've assigned a low probability (0.10).\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.",

This leans towards a higher probability of being single.\n* The tone of the comment is introspective and self-focused, which might indicate that the author is not currently in a romantic relationship.\n* The author's emphasis on the concept of \"home\" and their personal growth suggests a sense of independence, which could also support the idea that they are single.\n* The mention of \"shuffling around for work\" implies that the author might be in a transitional phase, which could make it less likely that they are married or engaged.\n* The probability of being widowed or divorced is low, as there is no mention of a past partner or any emotional baggage related to a previous relationship.\n* The probability of being in a relationship is not zero, as the author might be in a casual or long-distance relationship, but the language used doesn't suggest a strong emphasis on a romantic partner.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comments.

This increases the probability of being married, in a relationship, or engaged.\n* The phrase \"home changes when priorities shift\" implies that the author has experienced a significant change in their life, which could be related to a change in their relationship status (e.g., getting married, moving in with a partner, or ending a relationship).\n* The topic of \"settling\" might indicate that the author is in a stable relationship or is considering long-term commitment, which supports the higher probabilities for married, in a relationship, and engaged.\n* The relatively low probability for single and widowed is due to the lack of language suggesting a lack of romantic involvement or a recent loss.\n* The probability of being divorced is moderate, as the comment doesn't explicitly indicate a recent separation, but the mention of \"priorities shift\" could hint at a past relationship ending.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as a rough estimate.",

The tone of the comment is also quite mature and responsible, which further supports this inference. The phrase \"those original dreams still smolder beneath all grown-up responsibilities\" suggests that the author has taken on significant responsibilities, which is often a characteristic of married or long-term committed relationships.\n\nThe probability of being divorced is low because the tone of the comment is positive and reflective, rather than bitter or resentful. The probability of being single is also low because the comment implies a sense of stability and commitment. The probability of being engaged is moderate, as the comment does not explicitly mention a partner or wedding plans, but the tone is consistent with someone who is in a serious relationship. The probability of being widowed is very low, as the comment does not suggest any sense of loss or grief.",

However, it's not a strong indicator, so I've assigned a moderate probability to these options.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and lighthearted, which might suggest a single person or someone in a relaxed relationship. This is why I've assigned a relatively high probability to \"single\" as well.\n* There is no mention of a partner or family, which makes it less likely that the person is married or engaged. However, it's not impossible, so I've assigned a non-zero probability to these options.\n* The topic of traveling is mentioned, but it's not a dominant theme in the comment, so I haven't given it too much weight in my analysis.\n* Divorced and widowed are less likely based on the tone and content of the comment, so I've assigned lower probabilities to these options.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a subjective analysis, and the actual relationship status of the user could be different.",

The user mentions getting married early and then realizing they prefer being solo, which suggests they are likely divorced. The tone of the comment is casual and conversational, which makes it less likely that they are currently in a romantic relationship. The probability of being single is higher than being in a relationship or engaged, as the user seems to value their independence. The probability of being widowed is very low, as there is no indication of a loss or grief in the comment.",

While I appreciate the fast-paced excitement of T20, there's something about the endurance and strategy of test cricket that resonates with me. It's akin to contemplating the vast, unhurried expanse of the cosmos in my field of astrophysics. Each ball, a star, with its own potential to alter the course of the game, much like a celestial event. But that's just me, a middle-aged astrophysicist, finding poetry in the sport.

The phrase \"divorce ain't for weak hearts\" suggests a sense of experience and reflection, which further supports this conclusion.\n* The tone of the comment is introspective and self-reflective, which might indicate that the user is not currently in a romantic relationship. This reduces the probability of being \"married\", \"engaged\", or \"in a relationship\".\n* The user's focus on personal growth and overcoming challenges (\"hit that grown-up vibe\", \"navigating through some real tough personal stuff\") might suggest that they are currently single, but this is a weaker signal.\n* There is no indication of the user being widowed, so I assign a probability of 0 to this option.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective estimates based on my analysis of the comments.

The tone is casual and lighthearted, implying a sense of pride and accomplishment in their parenting role.\n\n**Probability Assessment:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.60</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* **Divorced:** Low probability (0.05) as the comment doesn't hint at any negative sentiments or experiences that might be associated with a divorce.\n* **Married:** High probability (0.60) as the comment suggests a level of maturity and responsibility, which is often associated with married individuals. The mention of \"kids\" also increases the likelihood of a long-term committed relationship.\n* **Engaged:** Moderate probability (0.10) as the comment doesn't provide any direct evidence of an engagement, but it's possible that the author is engaged and has children from a previous relationship or is in a long-term partnership.\n* **In a relationship:** Moderate probability (0.20) as the comment doesn't explicitly indicate a romantic partnership, but the author's tone and language suggest a sense of stability and responsibility, which could be associated with a committed relationship.\n* **Single:** Low probability (0.05) as the comment mentions \"kids,\" which is less likely to be associated with a single individual.\n* **Widowed:** Very low probability (0.00) as there is no indication of loss or bereavement in the comment, and the tone is generally positive and lighthearted.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

This might be more common in someone who is in a relationship or married, as they may need to consider their partner's opinions or priorities. Hence, I've given a slightly higher probability to \"in a relationship\" and \"married.\"\n* The mention of \"budgeting\" and \"festival trips\" suggests that the person is likely young to middle-aged, which reduces the likelihood of being widowed.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and light-hearted, which might indicate a single person or someone in a relatively new relationship. This is why I've given a moderate probability to \"single\" and \"in a relationship.\"\n* The comment doesn't contain any explicit hints about a romantic partner or family, so I've kept the probabilities for \"engaged,\" \"divorced,\" and \"widowed\" relatively low.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the comment.

The mention of \"kid budgets\" implies a family setting, which is often associated with marriage.\n* **In a relationship (20%):** This possibility is also plausible, as the author might be in a committed relationship with a partner, but not necessarily married.\n* **Engaged (10%):** Although possible, I consider this less likely, as the comment doesn't explicitly mention a fianc√©(e) or wedding plans.\n* **Single (5%):** The comment's focus on \"kid budgets\" makes it less likely that the author is single, but it's not impossible.\n* **Divorced (5%):** The tone of the comment doesn't suggest a recently divorced person, and the mention of \"kid budgets\" implies a more stable family situation.\n* **Widowed (0%):** The comment's tone and content don't suggest a person who has experienced the loss of a partner.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are based on a single comment and may not reflect the author's actual relationship status.",

Hence, I assign a high probability of 0.8 to the \"divorced\" category.\n* The other categories (married, engaged, in a relationship, single, and widowed) are less likely, as there is no explicit mention of a current partner or relationship in the comment. I assign a low probability of 0.05 to each of these categories, as they are not directly contradicted by the comment, but are not supported by any evidence either.\n* Widowed is the least likely option, as there is no mention of a deceased partner, and the tone of the comment suggests a more recent event (divorce) rather than a past loss.",

This milestone is often associated with long-term commitment and stability, which is more common in married or engaged relationships.\n\n**Probability Estimates:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.60</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.00</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* **Divorced:** Low probability (0.05) since the comment implies a positive, long-term commitment, which is less likely in a divorced individual.\n* **Married:** High probability (0.60) as the comment suggests a significant milestone, often associated with married life.\n* **Engaged:** Moderate probability (0.30) as the comment could also imply a long-term commitment, but the language used is more commonly associated with married individuals.\n* **In a relationship:** Low probability (0.05) as the comment's tone and language suggest a more formal commitment, rather than a casual relationship.\n* **Single:** Very low probability (0.00) as the comment implies a significant life milestone, which is less likely for a single individual.\n* **Widowed:** Very low probability (0.00) as the comment's tone and language do not suggest a recent loss or bereavement.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective estimates based on my analysis and may not reflect the actual relationship status of the author.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\n**Output:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.35</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* The user's tone is casual and playful, which suggests a younger adult or someone who is comfortable with online communication. This leans me towards a lower probability of being widowed (0.00) or divorced (0.05).\n* The comment about \"adulting manual\" and the use of \"tbh\" (to be honest) and üòÜ (a laughing face emoji) suggest a lighthearted and humorous personality, which is more commonly associated with singles or those in relationships. This increases the probability of being single (0.35) or in a relationship (0.30).\n* The user's skepticism about the significance of the 40-year milestone might imply that they're not yet at that stage in life, which reduces the likelihood of being married (0.20) or engaged (0.10).\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough estimates.

Despite the informal style, your grammar is generally correct, a testament to your education, but you prefer simpler sentence structures for ease of communication. You engage with topics related to fashion, design, and lifestyle, and your comments often include personal anecdotes or opinions that showcase your creative mindset.\n\nExample: lol yeah, i get the white shirt struggle üòÖ but hey, as a fashion designer, i say embrace the chaos! ever thought about rocking patterns? they hide stains like a champ and you get to break the mold. btw, spilled drinks are nothing, try getting fabric paint out of your fav jeans... now that's a party foul üé®üëñ",

Personally, finding it a bit of a juggle to keep up the lifestyle that was pretty standard for our parents. Think holidays, dining out, even the odd splurge. Can't help but smile thinking back to dreams of owning that vacation home, now it's more like fantasizing about the next budget-friendly staycation, am I right? How's the squeeze playing out for you?

Fast forward to now, and sometimes it feels like those goals and the income don't exactly line up, but in other ways, life surprises you with perks you never thought of.

Despite the relaxed approach, your grammar is generally correct, a testament to your education and professional background. You engage with topics related to architecture, design, and urban development with more formality and precision, showcasing your expertise. When discussing personal interests or everyday topics, your tone becomes more laid-back, and you might throw in a joke or two, reflecting the typical Reddit banter.\n\nExample: hey guys, just saw the plans for the new park in mitte and gotta say, i'm pretty stoked. berlin's really stepping up its green spaces game. anyone else excited about this or am i the only architecture nerd here? üòÖ btw, if you haven't checked out the renderings, do it! it's gonna be a game-changer for the neighborhood.",

Found myself in projects I'd never imagined being part of (and loving it), but also hit some brick walls that had me contemplating if I picked the right card at degree gamble.

You're likely to engage in discussions with a logical and analytical approach, given your profession as an economist, but you also appreciate humor and don't shy away from a witty comment or a clever pun. You're not one to use excessive capitalization or emoticons, preferring to let your words convey your meaning clearly.\n\nExample: Ah, the classic white shirt dilemma at parties. As a guy, I totally get it. It's like we're all walking targets for the inevitable red wine sniper. But hey, at least it's not a completo con palta disaster, right?

However, you do enjoy engaging in lighter conversations and can occasionally adopt a more relaxed tone to fit the thread's mood. Your responses are thoughtful and you often provide context or examples from your own experiences, which adds a personal touch to your comments. You're respectful in discussions, even when you disagree, and you use your expertise to contribute meaningfully to conversations, especially on topics related to social issues, culture, or education.\n\nExample: I can totally relate to the nervousness before a big life event. Remember, it's normal to feel this way. I've seen many students of mine grapple with similar feelings as they approach major milestones. It's a sign that you're taking this seriously, which is a good thing. Just make sure you're communicating with your partner and that you're both on the same page. Marriage is a partnership, after all. And no, getting married at 29 would not be considered late at all here in South Africa. It's more about when you feel ready, rather than adhering to a specific timeline. Take a deep breath, and best of luck!",

This increases the likelihood of being in a relationship, engaged, or married.\n* The context of balancing activism work with a partner suggests a level of commitment and mutual understanding, which is more typical of a serious relationship (in a relationship, engaged, or married).\n* The tone of the comment is casual and conversational, which might indicate a younger adult or someone who is comfortable with their relationship status. This could lean against being widowed or divorced.\n* The user doesn't explicitly mention marriage or engagement, so I've assigned a lower probability to those options.\n* The probability of being single is low, as the user mentions a partner and the challenges of balancing their schedules.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.",

You tend to use proper grammar and punctuation, as precision in communication is something you value highly in your medical career. However, you also appreciate the informal nature of social media, so you might occasionally slip into a more relaxed tone, especially when discussing topics unrelated to your profession. You often provide insightful comments, drawing from your wealth of experience, and you're not afraid to share personal anecdotes when they're relevant. You tend to avoid slang and prefer clear, articulate language, but you're also not above using a well-placed emoticon to convey tone. Your Finnish background doesn't prominently feature in your language use, as you're quite adept in English, but you might occasionally reference your homeland when it's pertinent to the conversation.\n\nExample: Just celebrated my 20th wedding anniversary, and let me tell you, it's normal to have jitters before the big day. I remember feeling a mix of excitement and a bit of uncertainty, but it's all part of the journey. Marriage is a partnership that grows and evolves over time. As for the timing, here in Finland, people tend to marry a bit later compared to some other countries, so don't worry about the 'right age'. Focus on what feels right for you and your partner.

This increases the probability of being divorced or single.\n* The user doesn't mention any current partner or relationship, which makes it less likely that they are married, engaged, or in a relationship.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and relatable, which suggests that the user is not widowed, as they would likely have a more somber tone.\n* The user's focus on their personal life and relationships suggests that they are not currently in a committed relationship, making single or divorced more likely.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned probabilities as follows: divorced (0.3), single (0.3), married (0.1), engaged (0.05), in a relationship (0.2), and widowed (0.05).",

You tend to use a mix of local slang and Spanish phrases, which gives your comments a personal touch. Capitalization is inconsistent, as you don't always bother with it, especially when you're typing quickly or feel strongly about a topic. Punctuation is used sparingly, sometimes leading to run-on sentences or a stream-of-consciousness feel. You're not overly concerned with perfect grammar, but you try to make your points clear. Your comments often include anecdotes from your life as a taxi driver, and you're not shy about sharing your opinions, which can be quite direct. You enjoy engaging with others and often show support for fellow Argentines or those with similar life experiences.\n\nExample: hey there, so you're nervous about getting married? man, I remember my wedding day like it was yesterday... nerves are normal, just means you care about getting it right. I got hitched in my early 20s, pretty standard back then in Rosario. things didn't work out for me, but that's life, no? just make sure you're marrying for the right reasons, not because you feel you have to. suerte amigo!",

This implies that they have someone in their life who they are close enough to want to communicate with regularly.\n\n**Probability Assessment:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.50</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* **In a relationship** (50%): The comment suggests a level of intimacy and regular communication with someone, which is more likely to occur in a romantic relationship.\n* **Married** (20%): While possible, the tone of the comment doesn't necessarily imply a long-term commitment like marriage.\n* **Engaged** (10%): Similar to married, the comment doesn't provide strong evidence for an engagement.\n* **Single** (10%): The comment implies someone is being communicated with, making single less likely.\n* **Divorced** (5%) and **Widowed** (5%): These options are less likely, as the comment doesn't suggest a past relationship that has ended.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.",

This reduces the likelihood of being single, divorced, or widowed.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and conversational, which might indicate a comfortable, established relationship. This increases the probability of being married or in a relationship.\n* The mention of \"late nights designing\" implies a level of commitment and mutual understanding, which is more characteristic of a long-term relationship (married or in a relationship).\n* The phrase \"listening matters though\" suggests a sense of partnership and communication, which is also consistent with a committed relationship.\n\nBased on these observations, I've assigned the highest probabilities to \"married\" and \"in a relationship,\" with \"engaged\" being a possible but less likely option.

Despite the informal approach, your grammar is generally correct, a testament to your education, but you don't shy away from the occasional run-on sentence or fragment if it suits the conversational tone you're aiming for. Your comments often include personal anecdotes or opinions, and you're not afraid to show your humorous side. As an architect, you might occasionally drop in a technical term or a design-related comment when relevant, but you keep it accessible to the general audience.\n\nExample: oh man, i totally get where you're coming from. had a similar situation at a client presentation last week, where my model literally fell apart in front of everyone üòÖ talk about a nightmare, right? but hey, we live and we learn. gotta say though, nothing beats the feeling when everything just clicks into place, like that perfect alignment in a design. it's what keeps me going in this crazy field.",

This could also suggest a single or \"in a relationship\" status.\n* The user does not express any personal experiences or emotions that would hint at a married, engaged, or divorced status.\n* The probability of being widowed is extremely low, as the user's tone and language do not suggest someone who has experienced a significant loss.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comments.

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my interpretation of the comment.\n\n**Comment Analysis:**\nThe comment appears to be a lighthearted, humorous take on online dating, specifically Tinder. The language used is casual, with a touch of irony and playfulness (\"meme game aligns,\" \"unique vibes trying to click\"). The tone is optimistic, with a sense of hopefulness.\n\n**Probability Estimates:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.50</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.10</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* **Single:** High probability (0.50) due to the comment's focus on online dating and the lighthearted, casual tone, which suggests the user is actively looking for a partner.\n* **In a relationship:** Moderate probability (0.20) as the user might be in a casual relationship or exploring their options while still being open to new connections.\n* **Married/Engaged/Widowed:** Low probabilities (0.10, 0.05, 0.10) as the comment's tone and language don't suggest a committed, long-term relationship or a recent loss.\n* **Divorced:** Very low probability (0.05) as the comment doesn't convey a sense of bitterness or negativity, which might be expected from someone who has recently gone through a divorce.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment. In reality, the user's relationship status could be anything!",

Hence, I've assigned a relatively high probability to \"single\" (0.50).\n* The tone of the comment is introspective and curious, which might indicate that the author is not in a long-term committed relationship (e.g., married, engaged). I've assigned lower probabilities to these options (0.10 and 0.05, respectively).\n* The comment doesn't convey a sense of loss or grief, so I've assigned a low probability to \"widowed\" (0.10).\n* The author's focus on dating and relationships suggests they're not divorced, so I've assigned a relatively low probability to this option (0.05).\n* Finally, \"in a relationship\" is a possibility, but the comment's tone is more abstract and less personal, so I've assigned a moderate probability (0.20).\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough estimates rather than definitive predictions.",

However, the tone of the comment doesn't suggest a divorced person's perspective.\n6. **Widowed: 0.00** - There's no indication in the comment that the user is widowed, and the mention of a wife suggests that their partner is alive.\n\nThese probabilities are based on my analysis of the language, tone, and content of the comment. Keep in mind that these are subjective estimates and may not reflect the user's actual relationship status.",

This could suggest a lower probability of being divorced (0.05) or married (0.15), as these statuses might imply more traditional relationships.\n* The tone of the comment is playful and enthusiastic, which could indicate the author is in a positive, possibly romantic, relationship. This leads me to assign a moderate probability to being engaged (0.10) or in a relationship (0.30).\n* The fact that the author is sharing a personal, somewhat quirky interest online might suggest they are single (0.40) and comfortable with themselves, rather than being in a more committed relationship.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough estimates.",

You're also likely to share insights from your personal experiences living in Madrid, and as a middle-income professional, your comments are grounded in practicality and real-world perspectives. Your age might show through references to technology and social media trends that are popular among your peers, and you might use colloquialisms that are common in your generation.\n\nExample: Oh man, I totally get the white shirt dilemma. As someone who's had his fair share of wine mishaps at gallery openings, I've learned to always keep a spare shirt in the office. But hey, at least it's not the 18th century, right? Back then, if you spilled wine on your ruffled shirt, you'd be out of luck until your next monthly bath! üòÇ Anyway, pro tip: keep a tide pen handy, those things are lifesavers.

However, we can make some inferences based on the language and tone used.\n\nThe author mentions \"defying 'normal' hobbies daily,\" which suggests a sense of nonconformity and independence. This might indicate that the author values autonomy and self-expression, which could be more common in individuals who are single or in non-traditional relationships.\n\n**Probability Assessment:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.15</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's a brief explanation for each probability:\n\n* Divorced: Low probability, as there's no indication of past relationship trauma or bitterness in the comment.\n* Married: Moderate probability, but the tone of the comment doesn't suggest a strong emphasis on traditional relationships or family values.\n* Engaged: Similar to married, the probability is moderate, but the comment doesn't convey a sense of excitement or commitment to a partner.\n* In a relationship: Slightly higher probability, as the author's independence and nonconformity might lead them to be in a non-traditional or unconventional relationship.\n* Single: Highest probability, as the comment's focus on personal autonomy and independence suggests that the author may be unattached or prioritizing their individuality.\n* Widowed: Low probability, as there's no indication of loss or grief in the comment.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a limited amount of text. In reality, the author's relationship status could be any of these options, and this assessment should not be taken as a definitive prediction.",

The tone is lighthearted and humorous, which might indicate a relatively carefree and single person.\n\nHere are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.35</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* Divorced: Low probability (0.05) as there's no indication of a past marriage or relationship issues in the comment.\n* Married: Moderate probability (0.20) as the author seems aware of the pressure to get married, but there's no direct indication of being married.\n* Engaged: Low probability (0.10) as the comment doesn't suggest a current engagement or wedding planning.\n* In a relationship: Moderate probability (0.30) as the author might be in a relationship, but there's no explicit mention of a partner or relationship status.\n* Single: High probability (0.35) as the tone and language used suggest a carefree, possibly single person who's aware of social pressures but not currently in a committed relationship.\n* Widowed: Very low probability (0.00) as there's no indication of a past spouse or loss in the comment.\n\nKeep in mind that these estimates are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough guesses rather than definitive conclusions.",

You tend to use lowercase letters at the beginning of sentences and often neglect the use of proper punctuation, except for periods and occasional commas for clarity.

Despite the relaxed approach, your grammar is generally correct, a testament to your education, but you don't shy away from starting sentences with conjunctions or ending them with prepositions if it feels more natural in the flow of online banter. Your comments are peppered with cultural references from Romania, and you occasionally throw in a Romanian word or phrase, followed by an English translation or explanation, which adds a personal touch and connects with others from your region.\n\nExample: so i was at this party last night, and guess what, someone spilled »õuicƒÉ on my shirt. that's like a strong romanian spirit, for those who don't know. and it's not the first time, happens almost every time i wear something nice. anyone else got these party fails or is it just me attracting all the clumsy people? üòÖ",

After analyzing the comments, I'll provide my assessment of the relationship status probability distribution.\n\n**Input:** `<topics>home,comfort,cultures,settling,concept</topics>`\n**Input:** `<values>['divorced','married', 'engaged', 'in relationship','single', 'widowed']</values>`\n\n**Output:**\n```\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.60</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.15</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n```\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. The comment \"Neighborhood's buzzing, both spouses grinding away!\" suggests a sense of domesticity and partnership, which points towards a committed relationship.\n2. The use of \"both spouses\" specifically implies a married or long-term committed relationship.\n3. The topic of \"home\" and \"settling\" also supports the idea of a stable, long-term relationship.\n4. The tone of the comment is casual and lighthearted, which might indicate a comfortable and happy relationship.\n\nGiven these factors, I've assigned a high probability to \"married\" (0.60) and a moderate probability to \"in a relationship\" (0.15) and \"engaged\" (0.10). The other options are less likely, but still possible, so I've assigned lower probabilities to them.",

You tend to use lowercase letters at the beginning of sentences and often neglect the use of proper punctuation, except for periods and occasional commas for clarity. Emojis and internet slang are sparingly used, if at all, as you prefer to express yourself through words rather than symbols. You lean towards shorter sentences and paragraphs for easy readability. Despite the relaxed approach, your background in economics means that your comments are logical and well-structured, and you occasionally throw in economic terms or references when relevant. You're not one to shy away from a good-natured debate and will back up your points with facts or personal experiences. As a Belgian, you might occasionally reference local culture or European perspectives, especially when discussing global topics.\n\nExample: lol yeah the housing market is crazy right now, feels like you need to sell a kidney to afford a decent place in brussels üòÖ but seriously, with the ECB's policies and all, I'm just waiting for the bubble to burst. anyone else in europe seeing this trend or is it just us here?",

This neutrality in the language doesn't provide strong hints about the author's relationship status.\n* The use of \"solo earners\" might suggest that the author is more likely to be single or in a non-traditional relationship arrangement, which is why I've assigned a higher probability to \"single\" (0.30).\n* The tone of the comment is more observational and less emotional, which leads me to believe that the author is not currently going through a significant relationship change (e.g., divorce, engagement, or widowhood). This is why I've assigned lower probabilities to these statuses.\n* The probability of being \"in a relationship\" is still relatively high (0.25) since the comment doesn't explicitly rule out the possibility of a romantic partnership.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough estimates rather than definitive conclusions.",

The stuff we worried about, and the stereotypes we thought we had to live up to seem kinda outdated now, but I'm sure everyone's got their own take based on their experiences. For myself, I've stopped stressing over some of the traditional roles and started focusing on what makes me, y'know, actually happy. So, what's your story? How have your views on your gender role evolved over the years?",

Please note that this is a subjective evaluation based on the provided text and may not be entirely accurate.\n\nHere's my output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The user mentions \"stepping out of old labels\" and feeling a shift in societal roles, which might indicate a sense of liberation or a recent change in their personal life. This could suggest that they're not currently in a long-term committed relationship (e.g., married or engaged).\n* The tone of the comment is positive and enthusiastic, which might imply that the user is in a relatively happy and fulfilling relationship (in a relationship or single).\n* There's no explicit mention of a partner or romantic relationship, which makes it difficult to determine their current status with certainty.\n* The user's focus on societal evolution and blurring of roles might indicate an open-minded and progressive individual, which could increase the likelihood of them being single or in a non-traditional relationship.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as a rough estimate rather than a definitive prediction.",

There's no hint of sadness, longing, or regret, which might be present if they were recently divorced or widowed.\n\nHere are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>married:0.01</value_probability>\n<value_probability>engaged:0.01</value_probability>\n<value_probability>in relationship:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>single:0.85</value_probability>\n<value_probability>widowed:0.03</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my opinion, the user is most likely single (85% probability), with a small chance of being divorced or widowed (5% and 3%, respectively).

Just last week, I was at a book club meeting when a fellow reader gestured a bit too enthusiastically with a glass of red wine in hand. Needless to say, my copy of \"Anna Karenina\" now has a few colorful bookmarks. But, such is life, right? We live, we laugh, we clean the stains. üìöüç∑",

This increases the probability of being engaged.\n* The topic of personal space and balance in relationships implies that the author values healthy relationships, which might indicate a committed relationship (engaged or married).\n* The tone is positive and light, which reduces the likelihood of being divorced or widowed.\n* The author doesn't express any strong emotions or concerns about being single, so I've assigned a lower probability to this option.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

The fact that they mention scrolling through Reddit for a longer period than before might imply that they have more free time, which is consistent with being single.\n\nHere are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.75</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my assessment, the probability of the author being single is quite high (75%), while the other options are less likely.",

As a molecular biologist, I've got to say that the way beer is brewed is pretty fascinating from a microbiological perspective. Yeast, those tiny workhorses, are the unsung heroes here. They gobble up sugars and spit out alcohol and CO2, giving us the bubbly, intoxicating drink we all enjoy. And yeah, I'm based in Tokyo, so I've got a soft spot for some of the local craft beers here. Ever tried a Hitachino Nest?

The other options, including divorced, married, engaged, and in a relationship, are less likely, as they would imply some level of commitment or attachment, which doesn't seem to be the case based on the comment. Widowed is also unlikely, as it's not directly related to the context of the comment.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of a single comment.

This tone is more consistent with someone in a relationship or married, rather than divorced or widowed.\n* The use of metaphors like \"old engines\" and \"sailing ships\" implies a sense of experience and maturity, which may indicate a longer-term relationship or marriage.\n* The author's emphasis on \"stability\" and \"depth\" could suggest a committed partnership, but the mention of \"fun\" and \"sparks\" prevents me from assigning a higher probability to the \"married\" category.\n* The tone is not overly romantic or enthusiastic, which reduces the likelihood of the author being engaged or recently in a relationship.\n* The lack of bitter or negative sentiments in the comment makes it less likely that the author is divorced or widowed.\n* The probability of being single is relatively low, as the comment's themes and tone suggest some level of relationship experience.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comments.",

This might suggest that they're not in a long-term committed relationship like marriage or engagement.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and relatable, which makes me lean towards a younger demographic, possibly in their 20s or early 30s. This age range is more likely to be single or in a relationship than married, engaged, or widowed.\n* There's no explicit mention of a partner or romantic relationship, which makes it difficult to determine the author's relationship status with certainty.\n\nGiven these factors, I've assigned higher probabilities to \"single\" and \"in a relationship\" (both 0.30), as these statuses seem more plausible based on the comment. The other options have lower probabilities, with \"married\" and \"engaged\" being less likely due to the author's emphasis on independence and busy schedule. \"Divorced\" and \"widowed\" are even less likely, as there's no indication of a previous marriage or loss of a partner.",

Just last month, I was at this fancy gathering, and someone knocked over a centerpiece that almost hit my model of a sustainable housing project. Luckily, it missed, but talk about a heart-stopping moment! I guess it's not just white shirts that attract trouble. Anyway, always have a backup plan, or in your case, maybe a backup shirt? Stay sharp, and maybe avoid those red wine zones!",

This reduces the likelihood of being widowed or divorced at a young age.\n* The analogy of a \"co-op partner\" implies a desire for a collaborative and supportive relationship, which is consistent with being in a relationship or married.\n* The tone of the comment is reflective and self-aware, which might indicate a level of maturity and stability, increasing the probability of being in a committed relationship (married, engaged, or in a relationship).\n* The author doesn't express any strong emotions or frustrations that might suggest a recent divorce or separation.\n* The probability of being single is still relatively high, as the comment doesn't provide explicit evidence of a current partner.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my interpretation of the comment.",

This leads me to believe that the user is more likely to be in a committed relationship (married or in a relationship) rather than single or engaged.\n* The phrase \"love matures alongside us\" implies a sense of growth and development in a relationship, which is more consistent with a long-term committed relationship (married or in a relationship) rather than a newer engagement or a single person.\n* The tone is positive and optimistic, which reduces the likelihood of the user being divorced or widowed.\n* While it's possible that the user is single or engaged, the language used suggests a more established relationship, which is why I've assigned lower probabilities to these options.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough estimates.",

You tend to use lowercase letters, even at the beginning of sentences, and often neglect proper punctuation, except for necessary commas and periods to avoid confusion.

You mix in British colloquialisms with a touch of Hungarian influence, sometimes using phrases or words from your native language when you're particularly moved or want to add a personal touch. Your grammar is generally correct, but you're not overly concerned with adhering to every rule, prioritizing the flow of conversation and the expression of your thoughts over strict correctness. You're also likely to reference your studies in economics or your life in London when relevant, and your comments often show empathy and a desire to connect with others, reflecting your relationship-oriented nature.\n\nExample: lol yeah, the tube during rush hour is like a real-life econ lesson in resource scarcity üòÇ every man for himself, and i'm just there tryna not spill my coffee. gotta love london, right? btw, anyone else from budapest here? k√©rek egy kis t√ºrelmet, amikor a metr√≥ olyan, mint egy sard√≠nia doboz üêüüöá",

The use of a scientific analogy (comparing relationships to chemical reactions) also suggests a level of introspection and analysis that might be more characteristic of someone who is currently in a relationship.\n\nThe probability of being \"in a relationship\" is highest because the comment seems to be written from a place of experience and introspection, which is more likely to come from someone who is currently in a relationship. The probability of being \"single\" is also relatively high because the comment doesn't necessarily imply that they are currently in a relationship, and the tone is more observational than personal.\n\nThe probabilities of being \"divorced\", \"married\", or \"engaged\" are lower because the comment doesn't provide any specific details that would suggest a long-term commitment or a recent change in relationship status. The probability of being \"widowed\" is very low because there is no indication of a recent loss or grief in the comment.",

You tend to use lowercase letters for a relaxed feel, though you do capitalize when it feels natural or necessary.

Your grammar is generally correct, but you're not overly concerned with formalities, allowing for some colloquial expressions and occasional grammatical slips that give your writing a genuine and approachable tone. You often incorporate Portuguese phrases or references to your life in Lisbon, which adds a personal touch to your comments.\n\nExample: ah, the joys of technology, right? back in my day, we'd just meet up at the local caf√© and chat for hours. now, everything's online. gotta say though, it's not all bad, I've met some great folks on forums like this. and hey, if you're ever in lisbon, hit me up for a coffee - I'll show you the best spots, the ones only us locals know üòâüáµüáπ",

This increases the likelihood of being in a relationship or married.\n* The topic of dessert and a specific type of dessert (\"chocoflan\") being mentioned suggests a level of domesticity and comfort, which is more common in long-term relationships or marriages.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and affectionate, which is consistent with a romantic partner.\n* There's no indication of a recent breakup or negative emotions, which reduces the likelihood of being divorced or single.\n* The language used is informal, which might suggest a younger adult, making widowhood less likely.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned a higher probability to being married (40%) or in a relationship (30%), with a smaller chance of being engaged (15%). The other options are less likely, but still possible.",

This increases the probability of being married, engaged, or in a relationship.\n* The tone of the comment is lighthearted and playful, which is consistent with someone who is in a happy relationship.\n* The mention of \"quirks\" and \"priceless\" implies a sense of affection and appreciation, which is more common in committed relationships.\n* The probability of being single or widowed is lower, as the comment doesn't convey a sense of loneliness or grief.\n* The probability of being divorced is also relatively low, as the comment doesn't suggest a negative or bitter tone.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

The author explicitly states \"since I've been riding solo\" and asks a question directed at \"Singles of Reddit\", which indicates that they identify as single. The content of the post also focuses on personal growth and hobbies in the context of being unattached, further supporting this conclusion. Therefore, I assign a high probability (0.80) to the author being single. The other relationship statuses are assigned a low probability (0.05) as they do not align with the language and tone of the comment. Widowed is assigned a probability of 0.00 as there is no indication of the author having experienced a loss of a partner.",

You tend to use proper punctuation and grammar, as it's a habit from your professional life as a philosophy professor.

You often incorporate philosophical references or French idioms, subtly hinting at your nationality and profession. Despite your high level of education, you aim to be accessible and not overly formal, so you might occasionally use contractions or colloquial expressions to blend in with the diverse community. You avoid using slang that might be popular with younger generations, as it doesn't come naturally to you. Your comments are thoughtful and often provide a different perspective, reflecting your philosophical training.\n\nExample: Ah, the eternal question of readiness for marriage. In France, there's a saying, \"Il n'y a pas d'√¢ge pour le mariage, seulement des √¢mes pr√™tes √† s'engager.\" It means there's no age for marriage, only souls ready to commit. I was married once, and while it didn't last, the experience taught me that age is less significant than understanding yourself and your partner. Take a moment to reflect on what commitment means to you. Philosophy aside, it's normal to feel nervous, but trust your instincts. They're the best guide you have.",

However, your grammar is generally correct, likely due to your education in system analysis.

You occasionally throw in references to your Ukrainian heritage or life in Serbia, which adds a personal touch to your comments.\n\nExample: lol yeah, so i was debugging this piece of code for hours and it turns out the issue was a missing semicolon, classic. btw, anyone else in belgrade dealing with the insane amount of popups on some local news sites? feels like i'm back in the early 2000s with all these ads, might as well throw in a dial-up tone for the full experience üòÖ",

This increases the likelihood of being married or in a relationship.\n* The tone of the comment is reflective and analytical, which might indicate a level of maturity and stability, pointing towards a committed relationship (married or in a relationship).\n* The user doesn't express strong emotions or personal experiences, which reduces the likelihood of being single or recently divorced/widowed.\n* The mention of \"adaptation & commitment\" as key factors in relationships might imply that the user values long-term relationships, which again points towards being married or in a relationship.\n* Engaged is a possibility, but the tone of the comment doesn't suggest an imminent wedding or strong romantic feelings, so I've assigned a lower probability.\n* Single and widowed are less likely, as the user's comments don't convey a sense of loneliness or recent loss.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

The phrase \"all down to couple dynamics\" implies that the author has experience with or has given thought to the inner workings of romantic relationships.\n\nHere's my probability assessment:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.15</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* Divorced: 15% - The author might have experienced a divorce, but the tone of the comment doesn't suggest a strong emotional connection to the concept of divorce.\n* Married: 40% - The author's familiarity with the \"seven-year itch\" and \"couple dynamics\" suggests a high likelihood of being married or having been married in the past.\n* Engaged: 10% - While possible, the comment doesn't provide strong evidence of being engaged, so I've assigned a lower probability.\n* In a relationship: 30% - The author's interest in relationship dynamics could indicate that they are currently in a relationship, but the comment doesn't provide conclusive evidence.\n* Single: 5% - The comment doesn't suggest that the author is single, as they seem to have a level of understanding of long-term relationships.\n* Widowed: 0% - There is no indication in the comment that the author has experienced the loss of a spouse, so I've assigned a 0% probability.",

Divorced now, and honestly, life goes on. You'll know when you're ready, no rush. Âä†Ê≤π! (That's \"keep it up\" for the non-Mandarin speakers here.)",

Based on the provided comments, I'll analyze the language, tone, and content to infer the relationship status of the author. Here's my assessment:\n\nThe comment suggests that the author has had a significant relationship in the past, which has ended. The phrase \"until we realized our paths diverged anyway\" implies a sense of closure and acceptance, indicating that the author is no longer in that relationship. The tone is reflective and matter-of-fact, without any emotional distress or longing.\n\nGiven the topics of discomfort, superstition, and relationships, I'll assign probabilities to each relationship status range as follows:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.4</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.1</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.2</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* Divorced: 0.4 - The language suggests a past relationship that has ended, and the tone is reflective, which is consistent with someone who has gone through a divorce.\n* Married: 0.1 - The comment doesn't indicate a current, happy marriage, so the probability is low.\n* Engaged: 0.05 - There's no indication of a current engagement or romantic involvement.\n* In a relationship: 0.2 - Although the comment implies a past relationship, it's possible the author is in a new relationship, but the tone doesn't suggest a strong emotional investment.\n* Single: 0.25 - The author's reflective tone and lack of emotional distress suggest they may be single, but the probability is not extremely high due to the mention of a past relationship.\n* Widowed: 0.0 - There's no indication of a spouse passing away, so this option is highly unlikely.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comments.",

This reduces the probability of being divorced, single, or widowed.\n* The phrase \"New hobbies together\" implies a sense of togetherness and shared activities, which is more common in committed relationships like being married, engaged, or in a relationship.\n* The use of \"reinvent bonding\" suggests a desire to strengthen the relationship, which is more likely to come from someone who is already in a committed relationship.\n* While it's possible that the author is single and looking forward to finding someone to share hobbies with, the tone of the comment seems more consistent with someone who is already in a relationship.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.",

You enjoy engaging in discussions related to your interests and expertise, and your comments often include personal anecdotes or opinions that show your background in civil engineering and your life in Cairo.\n\nExample: lol yeah, the traffic here in cairo can be a nightmare, especially when you're trying to get to a construction site on time. but hey, that's city life for you. gotta say though, the new bridge they're building should ease things up a bit, fingers crossed ü§û. btw, anyone else here into urban planning and infrastructure? would love to hear your thoughts on sustainable development in mega cities.",

This, combined with the topic of relationships, activities, and families, leads me to believe that the author is more likely to be single than in a romantic relationship. The tone of the comment is also casual and relaxed, which doesn't suggest a strong emotional investment in a romantic partner.\n\nGiven these factors, I've assigned a relatively high probability to the author being single (0.50). The next most likely option is being in a relationship (0.20), as the author may still be open to the idea of a romantic partnership but values their independence. The other options, such as married, engaged, divorced, and widowed, are less likely, but still possible, as the author may be reflecting on past experiences or relationships.",

The tone is casual and lighthearted, without any indication of romantic involvement or family-related concerns. The focus on solo activities also reduces the likelihood of being in a relationship or married.\n\nGiven these observations, I've assigned a relatively high probability to being single (0.50). The probability of being in a relationship is lower (0.20), as the comment doesn't hint at any romantic involvement. The other options, such as married, engaged, divorced, or widowed, are less likely, as there's no indication of a partner or family in the comment.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

You tend to use lowercase letters at the beginning of sentences and often neglect proper punctuation, except for periods and occasional commas for clarity. Emojis and internet slang are not your go-to, as you prefer to express yourself through words. You do, however, use common abbreviations and sometimes merge English with Arabic transliterations when it feels natural or when you're addressing fellow Egyptians. Despite the relaxed approach, your grammar is generally correct, a testament to your education. You enjoy engaging in discussions related to your interests and expertise, and your comments often include personal anecdotes or opinions that show your background in civil engineering and your life in Cairo.\n\nExample: lol yeah, the traffic here in cairo can be a nightmare, especially when you're trying to get to a construction site on time. but hey, that's city life for you. gotta say though, the new bridge they're building should ease things up a bit, fingers crossed ü§û. btw, anyone else here into urban planning and infrastructure? would love to hear your thoughts on sustainable development in mega cities.",

This comment is quite neutral and doesn't reveal much about the author's personal relationship status.\n\n**Probability estimates:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning:\n\n* The comment doesn't indicate a strong emotional tone or personal experience related to divorce, engagement, or widowhood, so I've assigned lower probabilities to these options.\n* The author's focus on diversity and non-traditional arrangements might suggest that they're not married or engaged, but this is a weak signal.\n* The comment's neutrality and lack of personal pronouns make it difficult to infer a specific relationship status, so I've assigned a relatively high probability to \"single\" as a default option.\n* \"In a relationship\" is a possibility, but the comment doesn't provide strong evidence for this option.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

Your grammar is generally correct, but you're comfortable bending the rules for effect or to convey a more conversational tone. You like to inject humor into your comments and aren't afraid to show your personality. Being a film editor and a film studies student, you occasionally drop references to movies or cinematic techniques, especially when they're relevant to the discussion.\n\nExample: lol yeah, that scene was like straight out of a wes anderson film, all symmetrical and color-coordinated. gotta love when life imitates art, or is it the other way around? üé•üòÑ",

Here's my reasoning:\n\n* The user mentions \"solo adventures\" and \"carving out what feels right career-wise,\" which suggests they may be focusing on personal growth and independence. This leans towards a single or recently single status.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and relaxed, without any mention of a partner or romantic relationship. This reduces the likelihood of being in a relationship, engaged, or married.\n* There's no indication of a recent loss or trauma, making it less likely the user is widowed.\n* The user doesn't express any negative sentiments or emotional baggage, which reduces the probability of being divorced.\n\nOverall, I've assigned the highest probability to being single (50%), as the comment suggests a focus on personal growth and independence. The other probabilities are distributed based on the lack of evidence pointing to other relationship statuses.",

I've assigned slightly higher probabilities to these options due to their relatively neutral nature.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough estimates.

You often incorporate a blend of technical jargon and colloquial language, indicative of your engineering background and your comfort with the online community. Your comments are usually well-structured and grammatically correct, but you don't shy away from using common internet abbreviations and slang when they feel natural. You also occasionally reference cultural elements from your life in India, which adds a personal touch to your interactions.\n\nExample: Ah, the classic white shirt dilemma at parties! As an engineer, I always appreciate the elegance of a crisp white shirt, but I've learned to keep a stain remover pen handy. It's like having a little bit of insurance against the inevitable. Last party I attended, someone knocked over their paneer tikka, and there I was, dabbing away at my shirt like it was a technical drawing in need of correction. Always be prepared, I say!",

The tone is introspective and experienced, implying that they have been in a relationship for some time.\n* The language used, such as \"rejigging aspirations\" and \"two paths entwine,\" suggests a level of maturity and commitment, which points towards a higher probability of being married or in a long-term relationship.\n* The author's focus on the complexities of relationships and the need for compromise implies that they are not single or recently divorced. The tone is not bitter or resentful, which reduces the likelihood of a recent divorce.\n* The probability of being engaged is lower, as the comment doesn't explicitly mention wedding plans or a recent engagement.\n* The probability of being widowed is low, as the tone is not melancholic or nostalgic, and the focus is on the challenges of relationships rather than grief.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective and based on my analysis of the provided comment.",

Your posts are usually well-structured, with clear points and logical flow, which is a nod to your academic training. You might occasionally use Japanese words or phrases, especially when discussing topics related to Japan, which adds a personal touch and highlights your cultural background. Despite your high level of education, you avoid coming across as pedantic, striving instead to contribute meaningfully to discussions with a tone that is friendly and open to dialogue.\n\nExample: Just stumbled upon this thread and couldn't resist chiming in. As a molecular biologist, I've got to say that the way beer is brewed is pretty fascinating from a microbiological perspective. Yeast, those tiny workhorses, are the unsung heroes here. They gobble up sugars and spit out alcohol and CO2, giving us the bubbly, intoxicating drink we all enjoy. And yeah, I'm based in Tokyo, so I've got a soft spot for some of the local craft beers here. Ever tried a Hitachino Nest? It's a bit different from your typical IPA but definitely worth a shot if you're into experimenting with new flavors. Kanpai! (That's \"cheers\" in Japanese, by the way.)",

I've assigned a moderate probability (0.20) to the married option, as it's possible they've already gotten married since getting engaged.\n* The user's comment doesn't indicate any signs of being divorced, single, or widowed, so I've assigned low probabilities (0.05 or 0.00) to these options.\n* The \"in a relationship\" option is possible, but the user's mention of being engaged suggests a more formal commitment, so I've assigned a lower probability (0.10) to this option.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are based on my analysis of the provided comments and may not reflect the user's actual relationship status.",

This tone is more likely to come from someone who is currently in a committed relationship (married, engaged, or in a relationship).\n* The phrase \"solo magic's overrated\" implies that the author has experienced the benefits of being in a relationship and values the companionship and support it brings. This sentiment is less likely to come from someone who is single or widowed.\n* The tone is positive and optimistic, which suggests that the author is not currently experiencing the emotional turmoil often associated with divorce or the loss of a partner (widowed).\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probabilities to \"married\" (40%) and \"in a relationship\" (30%), with \"engaged\" also being a possibility (20%). The probabilities for \"single\" and \"divorced\" are lower, as the tone doesn't suggest a sense of independence or emotional distress. Finally, I've assigned a 0% probability to \"widowed\", as the comment doesn't hint at a recent loss or grief.",

This reduces the likelihood of being married, engaged, or in a relationship.\n* The lighthearted tone and focus on casual activities (pizza) implies a more carefree, possibly single, individual.\n* The comment doesn't convey any sense of loss or grief, making it unlikely that the author is widowed.\n* The author's perspective on relationships seems optimistic, which makes it less likely that they're divorced.\n\nSo, based on this single comment, I think the author is most likely single (40%), with a significant possibility of being in a relationship (30%).

The tone is reflective and wise, implying that the author has gained insight from their experiences.\n\nHere's my probability estimation for each relationship status range:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.2</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.4</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.1</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.3</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.0</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.0</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* Divorced: 0.2 - The comment's tone suggests that the author has experienced a significant relationship, but the phrase \"weathered enough storms together\" might imply that they're still in a relationship. However, it's possible that they're divorced and reflecting on past experiences.\n* Married: 0.4 - The comment's wisdom and reflective tone are consistent with someone who has been in a long-term committed relationship, such as a marriage.\n* Engaged: 0.1 - The comment doesn't explicitly suggest that the author is currently engaged, but it's possible that they're in a long-term relationship and considering engagement.\n* In a relationship: 0.3 - The comment's focus on the importance of weathering storms together implies that the author values commitment and is likely in a relationship.\n* Single: 0.0 - The comment's tone and language suggest that the author has experience in a relationship, making it unlikely that they're single.\n* Widowed: 0.0 - There's no indication in the comment that the author has experienced the loss of a partner, making it highly unlikely that they're widowed.",

While I don't have to navigate the perils of white shirts and red wine spills, I can relate to the frustration of attire-related accidents. In Japan, we have our own set of etiquette and dress codes that can be equally challenging. Just the other day, I had to attend a formal gathering where I was expected to wear a traditional haori and hakama.

Based on the provided comments, I'll analyze the language, tone, and content to make an educated guess about the relationship status of the author.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n\n* The comment mentions \"mine\" and \"we're,\" indicating a sense of partnership or togetherness.\n* The tone is casual and enthusiastic, suggesting a comfortable and happy relationship.\n* The topic of cooking and meal prep implies a domestic setting, which is more likely to be shared with a partner.\n* The use of \"our thing\" reinforces the idea of a shared activity and a sense of unity.\n\nGiven these factors, I'll assign probabilities to each relationship status range as follows:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.30</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the author is most likely to be married (40%) or in a relationship (30%), with a smaller chance of being engaged (20%). The probabilities of being divorced, single, or widowed are lower, as the language and tone suggest a more positive and collaborative relationship dynamic.",

You're likely to engage in discussions about technology, gaming, and current events, and your comments are usually well-informed and thoughtful. You don't shy away from longer, more detailed posts when the topic interests you, and you're respectful in your interactions, even when you disagree with someone.\n\nExample: Just saw someone trying to compare the latest smartphone to a PC from the early 2000s, and I couldn't help but chuckle.

This increases the likelihood of the user being in a romantic relationship.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and playful, which might indicate a comfortable and relaxed relationship dynamic.\n* The topic of salsa dancing, which is often a social activity, could imply that the user is not solitary or isolated.\n* The probability of being divorced or widowed is low, as the comment doesn't convey a sense of sadness or loss.\n* Being single is possible, but the mention of \"her\" makes it less likely.\n* Engagement and marriage are both possible, but the tone of the comment doesn't suggest a strong romantic or committed tone, so I've assigned lower probabilities to these options.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are based on a single comment and may not reflect the user's actual relationship status.",

Keep in mind that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise in online profiling and text analysis.\n\nInput: <topics>hobbies,plants,snacks</topics>\nInput: <values>['divorced','married', 'engaged', 'in relationship','single', 'widowed']</values>\n\nOutput: <values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>married:0.30</value_probability>\n<value_probability>engaged:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>in relationship:0.40</value_probability>\n<value_probability>single:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>widowed:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n* The comment mentions \"her camera,\" which suggests a female partner or friend. This increases the likelihood of the user being in a romantic relationship.\n* The tone of the comment is casual and playful, which might indicate a younger adult or someone in a happy, relaxed relationship.\n* The topic of hobbies and photography suggests a person with a creative and adventurous side, which could be more common in individuals in a romantic relationship.\n* The absence of any negative or bitter tone in the comment reduces the likelihood of the user being divorced or widowed.\n\nBased on these factors, I've assigned the highest probability to \"in a relationship\" (40%) and \"married\" (30%). The other options have lower probabilities, with \"single\" and \"engaged\" being possible but less likely. \"Divorced\" and \"widowed\" are the least likely options.",

Keep in mind that this is a subjective assessment based on the limited context provided.\n\nHere's my output:\n\n<input topics>hobbies,plants,snacks</topics>\n<input values>['divorced','married', 'engaged', 'in relationship','single', 'widowed']</values>\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>married:0.40</value_probability>\n<value_probability>engaged:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>in relationship:0.30</value_probability>\n<value_probability>single:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>widowed:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The comment mentions \"our respective corners\" and \"game night,\" which suggests a sense of togetherness and shared activities, making it more likely that the user is in a romantic relationship (married, engaged, or in a relationship).\n* The tone of the comment is playful and lighthearted, which may indicate a sense of comfort and stability, leaning towards a more committed relationship (married or in a relationship).\n* The absence of any negative or emotional language reduces the likelihood of the user being divorced or widowed.\n* The comment's focus on shared activities and hobbies also makes it less likely that the user is single, as they seem to have a partner to share these experiences with.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a limited sample size.

Your Australian identity might subtly show through your choice of words or references to local culture. You're likely to engage in discussions with a friendly and supportive tone, given your profession as a health consultant, and you might occasionally use jargon from your field, though you're careful to explain it if you think it might not be widely understood.

Planning my own wedding was a mix of excitement and stress. Just remember to take a moment for yourself amidst the chaos. And about feeling ready, I reckon there's no perfect age to tie the knot. It's all about where you're at in life and your relationship. As a health consultant, I'd say it's important to focus on your mental well-being during this time.

Here's my assessment:\n\nThe comment \"debates might seem rough but they spice up the relationship imo ‚Äì disagreeing over movies beats bland conversations any day! keeps things interesting tbh\" suggests that the user is in a romantic relationship and values the dynamic and engaging aspects of it. The tone is casual and playful, indicating a sense of comfort and familiarity with their partner.\n\nGiven the topics of hobbies, plants, and snacks, which are relatively lighthearted and everyday conversation topics, I'll adjust my probabilities accordingly. Here's my output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.25</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.15</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.40</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.05</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nI've assigned a high probability to \"in a relationship\" (0.40) based on the user's comment, which explicitly mentions \"relationship\" and implies a sense of partnership. I've also given a moderate probability to \"married\" (0.25) and \"engaged\" (0.15), as the user's tone and language suggest a level of commitment and closeness. The probabilities for \"single\" (0.10), \"divorced\" (0.05), and \"widowed\" (0.05) are lower, as the user's comment doesn't suggest a lack of romantic involvement or a history of separation.",

You often incorporate historical references or facts when relevant, showcasing your expertise without being pedantic. As a Spaniard, you might occasionally infuse your English with European flair or mention local Spanish customs and places when they add to the conversation. You're also likely to share insights from your personal experiences living in Madrid, and as a middle-income professional, your comments are grounded in practicality and real-world perspectives. Your age might show through references to technology and social media trends that are popular among your peers, and you might use colloquialisms that are common in your generation.\n\nExample: Oh man, I totally get the white shirt dilemma. As someone who's had his fair share of wine mishaps at gallery openings, I've learned to always keep a spare shirt in the office. But hey, at least it's not the 18th century, right? Back then, if you spilled wine on your ruffled shirt, you'd be out of luck until your next monthly bath! üòÇ Anyway, pro tip: keep a tide pen handy, those things are lifesavers.

Please note that these are subjective probabilities based on my expertise and may not reflect the user's actual relationship status.\n\n**Comment Analysis:**\nThe comment appears to be a humorous, lighthearted remark about having a room full of fabric (for crafting) rather than people. This suggests that the user might be someone who values solo activities or has a strong interest in hobbies. There's no direct mention of relationships or personal life, which makes it more challenging to infer their relationship status.\n\n**Probability Estimates:**\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.50</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.10</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nHere's a brief explanation for each probability estimate:\n\n* Divorced, Married, Engaged: Low probabilities, as there's no indication of a romantic partner or past relationship mentioned in the comment.\n* In a relationship: A moderate probability, as the user's focus on solo activities might suggest they're not currently in a committed relationship.\n* Single: The highest probability, as the comment's tone and content don't imply a romantic partner or relationship concerns.\n* Widowed: A low probability, as there's no hint of a past partner or loss mentioned in the comment.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are based on a single comment and should be taken as rough estimates.

This tone suggests the author is likely single or not in a serious relationship.\n* The lack of emotional investment or personal experience mentioned in the comment makes it less likely that the author is divorced, widowed, or in a committed relationship (married, engaged).\n* The author's focus on the financial aspect of a partner implies that they might be considering relationships or dating, which increases the probability of being single.\n* The tone is not overly negative or bitter, which reduces the likelihood of the author being divorced or widowed.\n\nKeep in mind that these probabilities are subjective estimates based on a single comment and should be taken as rough guesses rather than definitive conclusions.",

The tone is casual and carefree, which further supports this interpretation.\n\nHere are my probability estimates:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.01</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.01</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.80</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.03</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn this analysis, I've assigned a high probability to \"single\" (0.80) since the comment suggests a sense of independence and freedom, which is consistent with being single.

You like to include emojis or emoticons to convey tone, which is common in online Japanese communication. Your comments often include references to life in Tokyo or cultural insights, and you enjoy engaging in discussions about technology, business trends, and social media.\n\nExample: lol yeah, Tokyo life means tiny apartments and even tinier kitchens üòÖ but hey, it's all about that konbini life, amirite? 7-11 dinners for the win when you're crunching numbers all day. btw, anyone else think that the new startup scene here is kinda blowing up? üöÄüìà",

As a molecular biologist, I've got to say that the way beer is brewed is pretty fascinating from a microbiological perspective. Yeast, those tiny workhorses, are the unsung heroes here. They gobble up sugars and spit out alcohol and CO2, giving us the bubbly, intoxicating drink we all enjoy. And yeah, I'm based in Tokyo, so I've got a soft spot for some of the local craft beers here. Ever tried a Hitachino Nest?

The phrase \"leveling up takes time\" suggests a focus on personal growth and self-improvement, which might indicate that they're not prioritizing romantic relationships at the moment. The tone is casual and relaxed, with a hint of humor, which doesn't suggest someone who's recently gone through a divorce or is currently widowed.\n\nGiven these factors, here's my probability distribution for the user's relationship status:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n  <value_probability>divorced:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>married:0.10</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>engaged:0.05</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>in relationship:0.20</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>single:0.60</value_probability>\n  <value_probability>widowed:0.00</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nIn my estimation, the user is most likely single (60% probability), with a moderate chance of being in a relationship (20%).

The seeking of online company might indicate a lack of fulfillment in their current relationship, but it's not a strong indicator.\n* **Married/Engaged:** 0.10/0.05 - These options are less likely, as the user's comment doesn't suggest a strong sense of commitment or partnership.\n* **Divorced/Widowed:** 0.05/0.10 - These options are also less likely, as the user's comment doesn't convey a sense of loss or grief that might be associated with these relationship statuses.\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment.

As a Slovenian, you occasionally reference your country or European context, which adds a unique perspective to discussions.\n\nExample: lol yeah, getting married can be super nerve-wracking, but hey, it's also a big adventure, right? i'm married myself and here in slovenia, it's pretty common to tie the knot in your late 20s or early 30s, so you're not alone in the timing game. just enjoy the ride and don't sweat the small stuff, it's all about you and your partner at the end of the day. oh, and pro tip: make sure you both get a slice of that wedding cake, it's surprisingly easy to miss out with all the chaos üòÇüç∞",

Instant connection. But now, after a few steep learning curves, my thoughts are like maybe \"the one\" is just a myth? Or maybe it's not this magical thing but more like someone you vibe with who's willing to put up with you when you're hangry? Recently got engaged and gotta say, it feels right, but boyyy did we work through some stuff to get here. Wondering how growing up and getting more 'life' under your belt has changed your take on this. Anyone else had their views on love evolve over time?",

Here's my output:\n\n<values_with_probability>\n<value_probability>divorced:0.10</value_probability>\n<value_probability>married:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>engaged:0.05</value_probability>\n<value_probability>in relationship:0.20</value_probability>\n<value_probability>single:0.50</value_probability>\n<value_probability>widowed:0.10</value_probability>\n</values_with_probability>\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* The user seems to be encouraging people to take responsibility for their own personal growth and not blame the concept of \"the one\" for their lack of effort in relationships. This tone suggests that the user might be single, as they're offering advice from a more detached perspective. Hence, I've assigned a relatively high probability to \"single\" (0.50).\n* The user's language is casual and conversational, which might indicate that they're not currently in a committed relationship (e.g., married, engaged). I've assigned lower probabilities to these options (0.05 each).\n* The user's emphasis on the importance of effort in relationships could imply that they've had some experience with relationships in the past, which might have ended in divorce or a similar situation. I've assigned a moderate probability to \"divorced\" (0.10).\n* The user's tone doesn't suggest that they're currently grieving or dealing with the loss of a partner, so I've assigned a relatively low probability to \"widowed\" (0.10).\n* The user's language doesn't provide strong indicators of being in a relationship, so I've assigned a moderate probability to \"in a relationship\" (0.20).\n\nPlease note that these probabilities are subjective and based on a single comment. They should not be taken as definitive predictions.",
