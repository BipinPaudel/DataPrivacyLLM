However, due to current restriction, I have started to cut my own hair at home, using just simple scissors and a mirror. Saved me a decent chunk as I don't have to tip the barber now! Haha! Tell me, did you ever have to manage your own haircut or grooming? If so, how was your experience with that?",

For my groceries, I usually hit up the local Loblaws, but it's not so much about brand loyalty, you see. I kinda try to circumnavigate the brand game and focus more on what I need for the week ‚Äì might be an effect of my psych background, avoiding manipulation and all, haha. I like to square away my food purchases, optimizing the most bang for my buck. Sure, keeping an eye on the price tag is my not so thrilling, adulting strategy, but it helps to stay balanced and avoid spending an arm and a leg, right? üòÑ Anyone got tips for growing herbs indoors though?

This suggests that they likely have a decent income to afford living in the city.\n* The author is concerned about optimizing their grocery shopping and keeping an eye on the price tag, which indicates that they are budget-conscious and likely have a moderate income.\n* The author has a \"psych background\", which could imply that they have a degree in psychology, which typically requires a bachelor's or master's degree. This level of education is often associated with a middle-class income.\n* The author's writing style is clear and articulate, suggesting that they are well-educated and possibly have a white-collar job, which is often associated with a middle-class income.\n* The author's tone is casual and conversational, but not flashy or extravagant, which suggests that they are not extremely wealthy.\n\nOverall, based on these factors, I believe the author's yearly income is likely in the middle range, between 30-60k USD.",

She could easily afford to rent a nice apartment in a gentrified area because of the new income. Looking back, after I graduated‚Äîfeel like it was centuries ago‚ÄîI had to share a small studio with a friend in a more affordable part of town for quite some years. So what was your living situation like after you graduated? Any housing or relocation struggles or were you quite set directly? Or, perhaps, are you still a student? How are you managing things right now?",

Try making a weekly budget, I use nicknames for different categories like 'rainy day savings', 'treat yo self', 'bare necessities', u know? Seems daft but it helps visualize where money is going. Also, dine in more? there are so many cool recipes online, i've become a pro at Portuguese cuisine ;) being at home more also means more time to cook up a storm. Plus, it's way cheaper (and often healthier) than eating out frequently. Maybe see if it works for you too? oh, and don't forget about free events in the city when things start to look safer after all this COVID stuff, Lisbon always has something fun going on for cheap or nothing.

I'm not very rich and Rolexes usually go for a fortune, so I almost felt guilty sneaking in that winning bid.
