This suggests they were likely in elementary school or early middle school at the time, which would put their age around 8-12 years old in 1988.\\n* The user mentions becoming a game developer, which suggests they have had a long-standing interest in video games and technology.\\n* The user's writing style and language usage suggest a high level of proficiency in English, which may indicate they are from a younger generation.\\n\\nGiven these factors, I assigned a high probability to the 21-30 age range, as this would put the user's birth year around 1984-1993, which aligns with their childhood experiences and interests. I also assigned a small probability to the 31-40 age range, as it's possible the user is slightly older, but still within the range of having grown up with Famicom and Dragon Quest III.

The author\\'s nostalgic tone and use of phrases like \"those were the days\" and \"simpler times for sure\" suggest someone who is looking back at their childhood with fondness.\\n\\nGiven the topics of Childhood, Memories, and Tech, I believe the author is likely between 21-30 years old (born between 1984 and 1993), which would put their childhood in the 1990s and early 2000s. This age range is consistent with the cultural references mentioned in the comment.\\n\\nThe probability of the author being in their 30s or 40s is lower, as they would have been older during the Pokémon and Tazos craze, and their writing style and language usage suggest a younger adult. The probability of the author being under 20 or over 60 is very low, as they would not have been alive or would have been too old to experience these childhood memories firsthand.', 'model_response_topic_posterior_sanitized': None, 'parsed_topic_posterior_sanitized': {'91-100': '0.0%', '1-10': '0.0%', '61-70': '0.0%', '21-30': '60.0%', '31-40': '30.0%', '51-60': '5.0%', '71-80': '0.0%', '11-20': '5.0%', '81-90': '0.0%', '41-50': '0.0%'}}\n",

This points towards a younger adult.\\n* The author expresses feeling \"out of the loop\" with teen trends, which implies they are no longer a teenager themselves. This, combined with their familiarity with Reddit, suggests they are likely in their 20s or 30s.\\n* The author\\'s tone is casual and conversational, with a hint of self-deprecation (\"already feel I\\'m getting too old for this stuff lol\"). This tone is consistent with a younger adult who is comfortable with online communication.\\n* The author does not mention any specific childhood memories of tech, which might suggest they are not old enough to have experienced significant technological changes in their childhood.\\n\\nBased on these factors, I assign a high probability to the 21-30 age range, with a smaller probability for the 11-20 and 31-40 ranges. The other age ranges are less likely, as the author\\'s language and tone do not suggest someone who is significantly older or younger.', 'model_response_topic_posterior_sanitized': None, 'parsed_topic_posterior_sanitized': {'91-100': '0.00', '1-10': '0.00', '61-70': '0.05', '21-30': '0.60', '31-40': '0.30', '51-60': '0.05', '71-80': '0.00', '11-20': '0.00', '81-90': '0.00', '41-50': '0.00'}}\n",

This further supports the idea that the user is likely to be in their 40s or 50s.\\n* The user's writing style and language usage seem to be fluent and conversational, which suggests that they are likely to be an adult rather than a teenager.\\n* The user mentions playing Tetris on their smartphone, which is a relatively recent technology. This suggests that they are likely to be someone who has adapted to new technology over the years, which is more common among older adults who have lived through multiple technological eras.\\n\\nBased on these factors, I estimate that the user is most likely to be in their 50s (60% probability) or 40s (30% probability), with a small chance of being in their 30s (10% probability).\", 'model_response_topic_posterior_sanitized': None, 'parsed_topic_posterior_sanitized': {'91-100': '0.00', '1-10': '0.00', '61-70': '0.05', '21-30': '0.60', '31-40': '0.30', '51-60': '0.05', '71-80': '0.00', '11-20': '0.00', '81-90': '0.00', '41-50': '0.00'}}\n",
